<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a clinical research study?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A clinical research study, also called a clinical trial, looks at an investigational drug or medical device to see if it is safe, how it works in the body, and if it works to treat a specific disease. The term "investigational" means that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has not approved the drug or medical device that is being studied for use in a particular condition or disease. Clinical studies are run by doctors who are responsible for the study participants' study-related care. In the United States, the FDA, requires several phases of clinical research be performed to better understand the safety and effectiveness of investigational new drugs and certain medical devices.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How are participants in a clinical research study protected?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Each clinical research study follows a carefully controlled written research plan called a protocol, which describes what the researchers will do in the study. The protocol includes safeguards like criteria for study participation and instructions on how study staff are to conduct the study.

All clinical research studies and their protocols are overseen by regulatory agencies and ethics committees around the world that help protect the interests and safety of study participants. In the United States, clinical research is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, often referred to as the FDA. Clinical research studies in the United States are also monitored by ethics committees called Institutional Review Boards or IRBs. An IRB is a committee of independent doctors, nurses, and members of the community who help review clinical research to ensure that the rights of study participants are protected. IRBs are specific to the United States, while countries outside the United States use the term Ethics Committees.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the phases of clinical research?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical research studies for investigational drugs are done in steps or "phases." Each clinical phase has a different purpose and helps the study researchers answer specific questions about what is being tested. These phases are designed to minimize risk to study participants and advance clinical research by demonstrating whether an investigational drug is likely to be safe and beneficial to patients with a particular disease or condition. If an investigational drug fails during any clinical phase, it cannot continue or move into the next phase of research.

First comes pre-clinical testing, where an investigational drug is tested in a laboratory for safety and potential effectiveness before it can be tested in humans. From there, the investigational drug moves into clinical studies, which generally fit into one of four phases. Phase I studies evaluate the safety and side effects of an investigational drug in a small group of people. Phase II studies evaluate the effectiveness of the drug in people with a particular disease or condition. They further identify the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the investigational drug. Phase II studies are usually conducted with a larger group of people than Phase I studies. Phase III studies further evaluate an investigational drug's safety, effectiveness, and side effects in an even larger group of people. Phase III studies help to confirm the findings of earlier research and may compare the investigational drug to existing approved treatments or to no treatment, such as placebo. Phase IV refers to any ongoing testing of a drug that occurs after a drug has been approved and made available to the general public, most often to evaluate its long-term effectiveness.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a clinical study protocol?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A protocol is a written research plan that describes a clinical research study and how it will be performed. A protocol defines the goals of the study, participation requirements (called inclusion and exclusion criteria), how long the study will last, the schedule of tests and procedures, and other key study information. The study team follows the protocol closely to ensure they run the study correctly. Using a clinical study protocol helps to ensure that multiple clinical study teams at various locations use the same standards for the study. This allows data to be combined from all study sites for analysis and evaluation. Protocols for studies being conducted in the U.S. must be reviewed and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or FDA. Protocols for studies being conducted outside the U.S. must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate countries' regulatory authorities.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is randomization? / Why is a study randomized?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Randomization is a process whereby study participants are randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to separate groups. Each group receives a different study treatment for comparison. 

In most clinical research studies, a participant is not allowed to know which study treatment he or she is receiving. In many studies, even the study doctor and staff do not know which participants are receiving which study treatment. This is done so researchers and patients do not expect certain results based on which study treatment is received. This would be called an "unintentional bias."

The randomization process allows researchers to evaluate the study treatments without any unintentional biases or input from the study team.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is informed consent?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The informed consent process and informed consent form help patients decide whether or not to participate in a clinical research study. The informed consent form provides key information about a study, such as the purpose of the research, its potential risks and benefits, what is required of study participants, and the rights of study participants. 

Before joining any clinical research study, potential participants who are age 18 or older and of sound body and mind are required to sign an informed consent form to acknowledge that they were provided information about the study and possible risks of participation and that they agreed to participate in the research. For children who are younger than 18 years old and adults who are unable to provide written consent for themselves, a parent or guardian will be required to sign the informed consent form for their child. Children may also be asked to sign a simplified version called an informed assent form.  

Participants can choose to leave the study at any time and for any reason, even after signing the informed consent form.</Content>

<Content id="0">The informed consent form describes the clinical research study, including the purpose of the research, its potential risks and benefits, what is required of study participants, and the rights of study participants. During the informed consent process, the study team will provide potential participants with the informed consent form to help address any questions they may have about the study. Potential participants should ask the study team to explain any words or information that they do not clearly understand.   

An informed consent form should only be signed after all questions have been fully addressed by the study team and the potential study participant is comfortable with the answers. Potential participants should take as long as they need to feel comfortable with their decision regarding whether or not to join the clinical research study.</Content>

Potential participants must also be given enough time to make that decision without any pressure from the study team. Study participants have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without any effect on their routine medical care.

Participants have the right to be told why the clinical research study is being done, what will be required of them as study participants, as well as any possible or known risks, discomforts, or side effects that may occur during the study. Participants will also be informed of the steps the study team will take to protect their personal health information, and to ensure that personal data collected during the clinical research study will be used only for the purposes explained to the participant prior to agreeing to participate in the study. The study team must answer all of a participant's questions at any time and provide a copy of the signed informed consent form.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Will there be other opportunities to enroll in a clinical study?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">It is difficult to say whether a particular patient will have opportunities to participate in other clinical research studies. Although new investigational drugs and medical devices are continually being researched in clinical studies, there is no guarantee that the patient will be eligible for another study. Patients can talk to their regular healthcare provider to learn more about other clinical research opportunities that may be available.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is blinding? Why is a study blinded?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical research studies are often described as being "single-blind" or "double-blind." 

A single-blind study means that the study researchers know which study treatment each participant is getting, but the participants do not. 

In a double-blind study, neither the researchers nor the study participants know which study treatment each participant is receiving. 

Studies are blinded to avoid bias and ensure that study results are not affected by researcher or participant expectations.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why is clinical research important?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical research studies help determine if investigational drugs and medical devices are safe and effective. Before any drug or medical device is made available to the general public, it has to go through several phases of clinical research and regulatory approvals. Most available medications and medical devices are the result of past research. Without clinical research, there would be no new medications or medical devices.</Content>

<Content id="0">Before participating in a clinical research study, potential participants should learn as much as they can about the study and ask the members of the study team any questions they may have. Some of the questions that a potential study participant may want to ask are answered on this website, for example: "what is being tested in this study?", "who can participate in this study?", and "how long will this study last?" 

These questions are just a few examples of the type of information that a potential participant should understand before agreeing to participate in a clinical research study. Please review this website for more details.</Content>

For some studies, potential participants who do not qualify at the screening stage may be allowed to screen again later. Clinical research studies all have different requirements, so a patient who is unable to join one study may still be able to join another.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What happens when an entire study is completed?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Once all participants have completed a study, the study data is provided to country-specific regulatory agencies who decide if the investigational drug should be allowed to move into the next phase of clinical research or if it should be approved and made available to the general public. This process may be lengthy, though the exact time it takes will vary depending on the study.

A summary of clinical study results, once they are available, are submitted to a public database.  This is to inform the public and medical community about what was learned from the clinical research study. Clinical study information and results may also be published in a scientific journal or medical publication. In all instances, specific information about you and other study participants is kept confidential. Your name and identity will never be revealed. 

Lastly, information and results about your participation in the clinical study may be provided to your clinical study doctor, which can be shared with you, for example, whether you were treated with the investigational drug or placebo or other study-specific information, such as your blood results.</Content>
