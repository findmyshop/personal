  <p>
    This program is provided by Allegheny Health Network to help answer your questions about Supportive Care.
    <br><br>During the program youâ€™ll be asked some questions to find out what kind of information or support will be helpful to you.  You may see a collection of short videos that explain a topic.  The videos in this section will advance automatically.  At the end of each video, you can explore the topic a little deeper by typing a question of your own into the text box, or by clicking on a related question or other topic in the menu.  After you watch the video response to your question, you'll be asked if you want to return to the collection of videos you were watching originally or continue to explore the content using the menu to the left.
