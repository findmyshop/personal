<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the factors behind a mental illness diagnosis?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Mental illnesses can be the result of several different factors and scientists believe that in most cases, a mental illness has more than one cause.  For instance, we know that mental illness may have a genetic connection, meaning that if someone is diagnosed with a mental illness, others in their family are more likely to experience mental illness.  We also know that traumatic events, such as natural disasters, violence, bullying or extreme stress can play a role in triggering the onset of mental illness.  Certain viruses can contribute to mental illness, especially when they affect fetuses and young children.  Substance abuse, toxins in the environment, and brain injury are also known to cause mental illness.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Common misconceptions of mental illness</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Among the greatest problems facing those who experience mental illness are the untrue beliefs that many people have about these brain disorders.   These untrue beliefs keep people from getting the help and support they need.  So, let's set the record straight.

The truth is:  mental illness is no one's fault.  Lack of information about the science of the brain led to mental illness being viewed as a problem of will power,  character, or even faith.

The truth is:  In most cases, people with mental illness who take their medication regularly and who do not abuse alcohol or other drugs are no more violent than people who do not have a mental illness.   The risk of violence increases when mental illness is left untreated.  And, as is true of everyone, with or without a mental illness, the risk of violence increases when someone is using illegal or street drugs such as crack, meth, cocaine, speed, and PCP.

The truth is: There is hope for people with serious mental illness.  People who get treatment for mental illness can lead full and productive lives.  Although it is sometimes difficult to find appropriate treatments and support, they do exist and ongoing research holds promise for new, more effective treatments with fewer side effects.

<BaseQuestion id="0">How is mental illness diagnosed?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There is currently no blood test, scan or other biological test to diagnose mental illness. Mental illnesses are diagnosed based on descriptions of symptoms, or clinical signs, which detail how a person feels, acts, behaves and thinks. The person having the symptoms most often gives the descriptions through a method known as "self-reporting", but it is also important for mental health professionals to get information from family members and others close to the person being diagnosed. It is important for mental health professionals to have as much information as possible when making a diagnosis.

The symptoms described are compared with details of each mental illness in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Illness or DSM. This manual is updated periodically, so it is common to refer to edition number for example, the DSM-5 when referring to the manual.

Because many mental illnesses have similar symptoms it can be difficult to get an accurate diagnosis, and getting the correct diagnosis is important for deciding what the best treatment is. If you feel that a diagnosis is not accurate, do not stop looking for the right diagnosis or treatment.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is bipolar disorder?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder in which people experience both episodes of depression and episodes of mania or hypomania.

Mania is a mood of excitement, euphoria, and over-activity that lasts for a week or more and causes a decrease in daily functioning. Hypomania is less severe and does not usually cause a decrease in functioning.

There are several different types of bipolar disorder that are defined by whether mania or hypomania is experienced. Bipolar type 1 includes periods of depression and mania. Bipolar type 2 includes periods of hypomania rather than mania.

For more information on Bipolar disorder, including how often it occurs and recommended treatments, see the Bipolar disorder Fact Sheet in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is borderline personality disorder?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Borderline personality disorder or BPD is characterized by impulsivity, doing things suddenly and without careful thought,  and instability in 		mood, self-image, and personal relationships.

	People with BPD can have mood swings including episodes of intense depression, 		irritability, and anxiety that last a few hours to a few days.  They often have problems with 	uncontrolled anger and impulsiveness.  Their impulsive behaviors can lead to 	overspending, substance misuse, dangerous driving and other risky activities.

	One of the key characteristics of BPD is the nature of the personal relationships that people 	with this disorder form.  Their relationships tend to be unstable and very intense, with 	extreme, "all good" or "all bad" views of people and experiences. Also, people with BPD 	have an intense fear of abandonment and will go to extreme measures to prevent it.

	Self-injurious behavior and suicidal threats are often a feature of BPD and people with the 	disorder have distorted views of their self-image and are uncertain about their own values 	and goals.

	For more information on BPD, including statistics on occurrence and recommended 	treatments, look at the Fact Sheet in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is major depression?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Major depression is not just feeling sad.  Unlike the feelings of sadness or loss which everyone experiences, major depression lasts from 6 months to a year and significantly interferes with thoughts, behavior, mood, activity, and physical health.

Major depression is common, it affects 9.9 million American adults, or approximately 5 percent of the adult population in
a given year and is the leading cause of disability in America.  It affects people of all income levels, races, and genders.

Common symptoms include:

Deeply sad or irritable mood
Changes in sleep, appetite, and energy not due to schedule changes or other health problems
Difficulty thinking, concentrating, and remembering
Physical slowing or agitation
Lack of interest in activities that were once enjoyed
Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, hopelessness, and emptiness
Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide
Persistent physical symptoms that are not due to other health problems such as headaches, stomach upset, and chronic pain.

Different people have different symptoms, and symptoms can vary based on sex, age, and culture, so be sure to look in the Resource Area for more information on major depression.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is postpartum depression?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Mood swings are a common and normal part of pregnancy and adjustment after giving birth.  Hormonal changes, stress, and lack of sleep among other things, can all contribute to feelings of moodiness and anxiety during pregnancy or the 2 to 3 weeks following delivery.  However, if mania, depression or anxiety last more than 3 weeks it may be due to a disorder that is commonly called postpartum depression. If untreated, postpartum depression may last for many months or longer.  Rarely, a more severe condition, called postpartum psychosis can occur.

Symptoms of postpartum depression include:

Loss of appetite
Insomnia
Intense irritability and anger
Overwhelming fatigue
Loss of interest in sex
Lack of joy in life
Feelings of shame, guilt or inadequacy
Severe mood swings
Difficulty bonding with the baby
Withdrawal from family and friends
Thoughts of harming self or the baby

In postpartum psychosis, the thoughts and feelings of postpartum depression become so severe that the person experiences a break with reality.  Signs and symptoms of postpartum psychosis may include:

Feeling removed from your baby, other people, and your surroundings, called depersonalization
Disturbed sleep, even when your baby is sleeping.
Confusion and disorientation
Extreme agitation or restlessness.
Hallucinations in sight, smell, hearing, or touch.
Delusional thoughts, or thinking that isn't based in reality.
Paranoia
Attempts to harm self or baby

Postpartum psychosis requires immediate medical treatment. If you or your loved one have any psychotic symptoms, seek emergency help right away. There is a high risk of harm to self or baby if postpartum psychosis is not treated.

For more information on postpartum depression and psychosis, please see the links in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is schizophrenia disorder?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Schizophrenia is a psychosis, a type of mental illness in which a person cannot tell what is real from what is imagined.  It has a broad range of symptoms that affect the way a person thinks, acts, manages emotions, perceives reality, and relates to others.

The symptoms of schizophrenia disorder are described in three categories:

Psychotic symptoms include delusions and hallucinations. Delusions are ideas or convictions that the person truly believes in, but are not true, such as believing that aliens are stealing their thoughts. Hallucinations are seeing, feeling, smelling or hearing things that aren't there.  People with schizophrenia will often talk about the voices they hear in their heads.  These are called "positive" symptoms because they were not present before the onset of symptoms and so have been added to the person's behavior.

Negative symptoms describe missing behaviors and abilities.  These include lack of emotional expression, described as flatness, the inability to start and follow through with activities, speech that is brief and lacks content, and a lack of pleasure or interest in life.

Disorganized symptoms include confused thinking, speech and behavior that may not make sense. For example, people with schizophrenia sometimes may not make sense when they speak and have trouble carrying on conversations.  Sometimes they move very slowly or make repetitive movements such as walking in circles or pacing; and they may have difficulty making sense of things going on around them.

For more information on schizophrenia disorder including statistics and recommended treatments look for the Fact Sheet in the Resources Tab.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is panic disorder?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Panic disorder is characterized by repeated and uncontrollable panic attacks in response to ordinary, non-threatening situations.
Panic attacks include 4 or more of these symptoms:  sweating; hot or cold flashes; choking or smothering sensations; racing heart; trouble breathing; shaking; chest pains; faintness; numbness; nausea; disorientation; or feelings of dying, losing control, or not being present in reality.

Many people have panic attacks at one time or another during their life, but that does not mean that they have a panic disorder.   Panic disorder is described as having four or more panic attacks in a four-week period, or recurrent or constant fears of having another panic attack.

Doctors often try to rule out every other possible alternative before diagnosing panic disorder because it mimics other ailments like heart attack and asthma.

For more information on panic disorder see the Fact Sheet in the Resource Area.</Content>

Self-injury is a symptom of mental illnesses such as borderline personality disorder, major depression and anxiety disorders.

The biochemistry of self-injury is complex.  The pain caused by the wounds releases "feel good" chemicals in the brain.  This produces a short-lived sense of calm well-being.   However, these good feelings are usually followed by guilt and shame on top of the return of the underlying negative emotions.

Examples of self-injurious behavior include:

Burning
Cutting the skin, sometimes to carve words or symbols
Breaking bones
Hitting or punching
Piercing the skin with sharp objects
Head banging
Biting one's self
Pulling out hair
Persistently picking at or interfering with wound healing
Picking or pulling out eyelashes

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is an anxiety disorder that can occur after someone experiences an event that caused intense fear, helplessness, or horror, like war, a hurricane, physical or emotional abuse or a bad accident.  It can result from personally experienced traumas or from seeing someone else experiencing a traumatic event.

Symptoms of PTSD include

Nightmares
Flashbacks, or feeling like the event is happening again
Avoiding places and situations that remind you of the event
Being hyper-alert to danger even in safe situations
Excessive worrying, guilt, isolation or sadness
Changes in sleep habits
Frequent angry outbursts
Thoughts of hurting yourself or others


People who have experienced a traumatic event may experience similar symptoms for a short while after the event, but with PTSD symptoms last longer than one month and affect daily functioning.  PTSD symptoms usually appear within three months of the traumatic experience; but they sometimes occur months or even years later.

Children with PTSD can have additional symptoms.  For more information on PTSD, look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Obsessive-compulsive disorder  or OCD is a disorder that causes recurring and stressful thoughts, fears or images called obsessions.  In an attempt to calm the anxiety and stop the obsessive thoughts, people with OCD perform specific actions or routines called compulsions.

Compulsions may be, excessive and repeated hand washing, counting things, repetitive thought patterns, checking and rechecking, hoarding, or arranging.  People with OCD feel they must perform these compulsive rituals or something bad will happen.

Examples of obsessions and the compulsions they drive might be "My hands must be contaminated; I have to re-wash them." or "I know I left the stove on: I have to go back and check".  To some extent, people with OCD know their obsessions are irrational but they cannot shake the anxiety the obsessions produce.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a mental health and substance abuse dual diagnosis?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A person with both severe mental illness and problematic drug or alcohol use is said to have a dual diagnosis.  It is a very common and particularly troubling problem because each disorder interferes with the treatment of the other.

For people with mental illness, drugs and alcohol can be a form of self-medication.  The temporary highs from substance abuse can ease the emotional pain of under- or un-treated mental illness but the underlying condition remains untreated and usually becomes worse.

Drug and alcohol misuse can cause a person who has no symptoms of mental illness to experience the onset of symptoms for the first time, and can worsen the symptoms of underlying mental illnesses.

The relationship between the two is complex, and the treatment of people with co-occurring substance abuse and mental illness is more complicated than the treatment of either condition alone.  Multiple scientific studies have shown that psychiatric treatments are more effective in people who are not actively abusing drugs and alcohol. Some treatment programs do not treat people who are actively abusing drugs or alcohol, and some require that substance abuse treatment take place at the same time as mental health treatment.  There has been a call for integrated treatment, in which treatment for the substance use is provided by the same team that is treating the mental health issues.  This can be helpful for people who are unable to remain sober but who need mental health treatment.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are eating disorders?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Eating disorders are characterized by preoccupation with food and weight issues.  People with eating disorders can focus on these issues so much that other areas of their life are negatively affected.  Without treatment, eating disorders can lead to serious, potentially fatal medical complications. Although eating disorders are commonly associated with women, men can develop them as well.  The three main types of eating disorders are:

Anorexia nervosa which involves denying oneself food to the point of self-starvation. A person with anorexia nervosa may deny that they are hungry and refuse to eat, severely restrict their calories, or they may vomit or use laxatives to purge after eating or exercise until they are exhausted to burn calories.

People with bulimia nervosa binge eat large amounts of food over a short time, and then vomit, use laxatives or excessive exercise to rid themselves of the calories.

Binge eating disorder or B.E.D. is losing control over eating habits and continuing to eat even when one is uncomfortably full. This excessive overeating leads to embarrassment, depressed or guilty feelings. Unlike anorexia or bulimia nervosa, a person with B.E.D. does not attempt to purge or exercise excessively after eating.

<Content id="0">If you think that that you or a loved one has a diagnosable mental illness, that person should see a mental health professional for a diagnosis.  They should also see a primary care physician for a complete physical to rule out any physical causes for the symptoms of mental illness.  Thyroid conditions, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and other disorders can mimic the symptoms of mental illness.

The best way to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and appropriate treatment is found is to educate yourself.  We encourage you to explore the content on this site and to access the links in the Resource Area for additional information.

Through education you can support loved ones by understanding their illness, giving them the time and space they need to recover, and helping them to find the resources they need for treatment and daily living.</Content>

<Content id="0">We are used to getting yes or no answers to questions about our health, you either have heart disease, or you don't, your blood glucose levels are either normal or elevated.  Diagnosing mental illness is not as clear.  No blood test, scan or other biological test currently exists to say whether or not a person is suffering from a mental illness, and even if the symptoms of mental illness are unmistakable, confusion exists because mental illnesses have different symptoms at different stages and many mental illness types and subtypes can share symptoms.

Also, mental health professionals often rely heavily on self-reporting of symptoms, which doesn't always present a complete picture of a person's behavior.  This is why it is so important for mental health professionals to hear from family members and others who share concerns over a person's behavior.</Content>

<Content id="0">You can help mental health professionals make an accurate diagnosis by making sure they get information from several sources.  Even if these sources do not fully agree on what is happening, it will help provide a complete picture and can prevent delays in diagnosis and treatment.    Also, record keeping can be extremely helpful in showing patterns of behavior.

We often hear that mental health professionals won't talk to family members of their patients because of HIPPA regulations.  However, HIPPA regulations do not prevent mental health professionals from listening to input from loved ones.</Content>

But, finding a mental health professional that is a good fit for you is key to getting an accurate diagnosis and treatment. Our members find that networking with other members can provide valuable first-hand information on providers.  Once you've made an appointment with a mental health professional, ask them about their approach to treatment.  If they don't seem comfortable answering your questions, you may want to look elsewhere.  In the Resource Area we've included a list of referral services as well as a list of characteristics to look for in determining whether a provider will be a good fit.</Content>

Let the dispatcher know that you believe a person with a mental illness is involved. Some police departments have Crisis Intervention officers and Psychiatric Emergency Response Team, or PERT teams who are trained to deal with mental health crises. Law enforcement officers will be sent to help. If they think that someone is a danger to themselves or others, options will include taking them to a psychiatric emergency room for assessment, or police custody. Many jails also provide psychiatric services.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can we prepare for a crisis?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">If you are an individual with a mental illness, you can prepare for crisis situations by making a Psychiatric Advanced Directive  or P.A.D., and completing a Wellness Recovery Action Plan, or WRAP, to let friends, family and other caregivers know what your wishes are should you be hospitalized or incarcerated.

Family and other caregivers can prepare by having crisis numbers at their fingertips and educating themselves about crisis response to mental health situations. Programs such as NAMI Family-to-family and Mental Health First Aid can help you prepare for dealing with crisis situations. We have included contact information and tips for handling crisis situations in the Resource Area of this page.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a psychiatric emergency response team? (PERT)</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Psychiatric Emergency Response teams, called PERT, consist of specially trained officers and deputies who are paired with licensed mental health professionals. Together, they respond on-scene to situations involving people who are experiencing a mental health-related crisis and have come to the attention of law enforcement. The goal is to provide the most clinically appropriate resolution to the crisis by linking people to the least restrictive level of care that is appropriate and to help prevent the unnecessary incarceration or hospitalization of those seen.

PERT's primary purposes are:

To provide clinical support to law enforcement and the community for calls involving persons having a mental health crisis via PERT teams.
To provide education and training to law enforcement on issues related to mental health and mental health related crises.
And to provide collaboration between law enforcement and the mental health system of care and mental health community.

There is an Emergency response plan you can complete and have handy for the PERT team. The plan is available in many languages on the PERT website.  You'll find a link to the site in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a mental health advanced directive?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A Mental Health Advanced Directive is also referred to as a Psychiatric Advance Directive or P.A.D.  A P.A.D. is a legal document written by a currently competent person who lives with a mental illness. It describes the person's mental health treatment preferences, and may name another person, called an agent, to make treatment decisions for the individual, should he or she become unable to make treatment decisions due to psychiatric illness. There are two kinds of P.A.D.s:

In Instructive P.A.D.s, the individual gives instructions about the specific mental health treatments the want if they experience a psychiatric crisis.

Proxy P.A.D.s name another person, called a health care proxy or agent who will make treatment decisions if the individual experiences a crisis that prevents them from being able to make their own treatment decisions.

For more information on P.A.D.s look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What happens after a person is released from involuntary hospitalization?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Every individual who has been hospitalized has the right to an aftercare plan.   The hospital must arrange for the initial implementation of the patient's discharge plan.

Aftercare plans must address personal preferences, family relationships, physical and psychiatric needs, financial needs, housing needs, educational/vocational needs, social needs, accessibility to community resources, and indication of anticipated problems and how to deal with them.

Consistent with the confidentiality policies, the patient and caregivers must be counseled to prepare them for post-hospital care.
And the hospital must transfer or refer patients, along with necessary medical information, to appropriate facilities, agencies, or outpatient services, as needed, for follow-up care or supportive services.

Look in the Resource Area for an aftercare-planning checklist.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What happens when someone is arrested?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Registered nurses medically screen every person who is arrested before they are accepted into the jail system. Screening is done for emergency, acute, and chronic medical and mental health needs. Patients in crisis are seen immediately and other patients are seen as soon as possible, with 24 hour priority given to urgent cases.

If the screening indicates the possibility of a mental illness, professional nursing and social work staff will perform a full mental health assessment.  Assessments are also done if someone expresses an interest in getting psychiatric care or they have been identified as having previously received psychiatric service. Mental health professionals are also responsible for scheduling follow-up services and advising jail staff on placement or special housing requirements.

Personal medications are generally not administered in jail.  If the medical team determines that medication is needed it is provided through the jail pharmacy.  Medical staff accepts medical or mental health information.  To alert jail staff of someone's medication needs, call the jail information line and ask to speak to a medical staff member or use the medication forms in the Resource Area.

Jail staff must follow privacy laws and will not release medical or mental health information unless the incarcerated individual signs a "Release of Information" form which names the specific individuals who are allowed to be given medical information. Private doctors are not allowed to see people who have been arrested.</Content>

<Content id="0">Jail medical staff accepts medical or mental health information.  To alert jail staff of someone's medication needs, call the jail information line and ask to speak to a medical staff member or use the medication forms in the Resource Area.

Jail staff must follow privacy laws and will not release medical or mental health information unless the incarcerated individual signs a "Release of Information" form which names the specific individuals who are allowed to be given medical information. Private doctors are not allowed to see people who have been arrested.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is mental health court?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Mental health court is a program that enables some individuals with mental illness who are arrested for non-violent crimes to be sentenced to treatment rather than jail.

Referrals to mental health court must be made by court officers and the individual must plead guilty to their crime and agree to fully participate in their treatment.

Each individual who is assigned to mental health court is provided with support such as adequate housing and health care, and access to therapy and medication, transportation, job training and education.  They are closely supervised to make sure that they adhere to the treatment plan that court employed mental health professionals prescribe.

The programs generally last 18 months and participants are on probation for 3 additional years.  Once they successfully complete their probation, they can apply to have their arrest record cleared.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I help my loved one who has been incarcerated?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Supporting a loved one who has been arrested can be extremely challenging and stressful. You can provide strong and effective support during this important time by doing the following:

When contacted by your loved one, stay calm and offer your support.

You can reassure them of the right to legal representation, and help with making contact with a lawyer if necessary. Attorneys familiar with mental health issues may be especially helpful.

Let your loved one know that a screening will be conducted for mental health issues, and that it is OK to discuss medical and mental health concerns with nursing and mental health staff. It is important that inmates feel safe to speak openly with these professionals.

If release is unlikely to occur soon, and you are concerned about important information reaching medical and mental health staff, you may contact the jail and ask to speak to a member of the medical staff or complete an Inmate Medication Information Form which you'll find in the Resource Area.</Content>

<Content id="0">Your family member may want to retain a private attorney or use the Public Defender's Office. A public defender will be assigned at arraignment if your relative does not have or cannot afford a private attorney. Do not be afraid to use a public defender. Public defenders often have knowledge of the system as it pertains to those who need mental health services.

If your family member decides to retain a private attorney, be sure to select one that is well versed in helping people with mental illness and understands how to access the treatment facilities and mental health services that are available.</Content>

<Content id="0">Forensic psychiatrists provide an objective opinion about the type and severity of an individual's mental illness to be used in making legal decisions.  They evaluate an individual's competency to stand trial or give testimony, and advise the court when an individual pleads not guilty due to mental illness and during sentencing recommendations. They may also be used to determine parental fitness or custody issues.</Content>

<Content id="0">Everyone who is arrested is assessed by medical professionals to see if they have a mental illness.  If they are found to have a mental illness, they will receive treatment for their disorder from jail medical staff.

If the medical team determines that medication is needed it is provided through the jail pharmacy. Personal medications are generally not administered in jail.  Other treatments may include development of appropriate treatment plans and opportunities for a variety of group therapies including Life Skills Groups, Cognitive Reorganization Groups, and Therapy Groups, supportive and crisis counseling.</Content>

<Content id="0">When we speak of recovery, we mean the ability to live a full and satisfying life with mental illness.  Recovery is a life long journey which is defined differently by each person.  Recovery means creating a life where mental illness is not the main focus, a life comprised of healthy relationships and interests, and the ability to become a part of society and to contribute to society through working, volunteering, or taking part in social activities.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What treatments are there for mental illness?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Numerous treatments and services for mental illness are available and the majority of people diagnosed with mental illness that receive treatment experience relief from their symptoms.

Effective treatment for mental illness should address all aspects of the illness, including the biological, psychological and social aspects.  This bio-psycho-social model of treatment provides comprehensive treatment including medication, psychotherapy, and social supports.

Biological treatments address the level of chemicals in the brain that regulate emotions and behavior and include medications and non-pharmaceutical treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy or ECT.  They can also include exercise, nutritional support and other holistic treatments.

Psychological treatments address factors that influence emotional and behavioral functioning including feelings and thought processes, goal setting, and self-awareness. These can include Interpersonal Therapy, or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

Social supports and treatments address environmental factors such as family and relationships, employment, housing and education, and peer support.

The choice and combination of treatment and services depends on the type of mental illness, the severity of symptoms, the availability of options and individual preference.   Most people with mental illness report that a combination of treatments, services and supports works best to support their recovery.

<Content id="0">After a mental health crisis, it is normal for there to be a recuperation period.   Mental illness crises have real and lasting effects on physical and emotional well-being.  Because of this, it is important that during this period of recuperation, people who have had a mental illness crisis need to rest and avoid stress.  It is sometimes difficult for family and friends to understand these needs because their loved one looks fine, but in truth, they are physically and mentally exhausted.  The best thing that caregivers can do during this period is to learn about the mental illness affecting their loved one, to support them in finding and getting treatment, and to listen to them as they find their way back to a new normal.</Content>

<Content id="0">While medication can be an important part of symptom relief and recovery, there are many non-pharmaceutical treatments available as well.

Other non-pharmaceutical medical treatments include electroconvulsive therapy or ECT, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or rTMS, and  eye movement desensitization and reprocessing or EMDS.

Holistic treatments are non-pharmaceutical and address aspects of physical health that impact mental health.  Diet and exercise are considered holistic treatments for mental illness as are meditation and acupuncture.

Psychosocial treatments provide support, education and guidance to individuals with mental illness and their families.  These treatments address the whole lived experience of people with mental illness, including employment, housing, and social concerns. This can involve talking to a licensed therapist or participating in self-help and support groups, working with an employment counselor or a case manager.

<BaseQuestion id="0">Is medication necessary?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Medication is not the only treatment for mental illness, but for many it is an important one.  Medication can help relieve symptoms and stabilize moods so that individuals can recover.  While other non-pharmaceutical treatments are available and very effective, some people find that using medication is the only way they can continue to function and live their recovery.

Many people don't like the idea of taking medications, whether for mental illness or even a virus.  Some people see illness as a weakness, and taking medication as an admission that something is wrong.  Others find the side effects worse that the illness itself.

The decision to take or not take medication is a personal one, and this causes much frustration and concern for family members and other caregivers.  They may see their loved one who refuses medication spiraling out of control, losing their livelihood, family and friends, living on the streets or being incarcerated because of a mental illness that is treatable.  This is heartbreaking to watch.  Sometimes it is the lack of awareness that is a symptom of so many mental illnesses that keeps people from accepting medications.   On the other hand, individuals with mental illness may refuse medication for many valid reasons.  Side effects can rob individuals of their feelings, making them feel numb.  They can make individuals feel zombie like, cause tremors and ticks that are sometimes permanent, and contribute to metabolic syndrome which increases the risk for weight gain, diabetes and heart disease</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What medications are used to treat mental illness?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are several classes of medications used to treat mental illness. These medications may be used individually, or depending on the individual's symptoms and response to medications, they may be used in combination. Individuals with one disorder may be prescribed medications from a different class of medication to treat specific symptoms. For instance, anti-anxiety medications may be prescribed to someone with schizophrenia who is experiencing anxiety or to someone with bipolar disorder who is experiencing acute mania.

Anti-depressant medications work by raising the levels of chemical messengers in the brain that regulate mood. Some common types of antidepressants are SSRIs, and SNRIs. Older antidepressant medications like tricyclic and tetracyclic anti-depressants and MAO inhibitors are not used as much any longer because of their side effects and their potential as agents of suicide if taken in large doses.

Anti-anxiety medications now include the same medications used to treat depression for long-term treatment. People with anxiety disorders may also be prescribed an older class of anti-anxiety medications called benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are usually only prescribed for short-term symptom relief because of the risk of developing an addiction.

Mood stabilizing medications work to prevent the manic episodes of bipolar disorder and can help anti-depressant medications work to combat the depressive episodes. Mood stabilizers are often used in combination with medications from other classes.

Anti-psychotic medications reduce the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, which can include hallucinations and delusions. Older medications, called neuroleptics, did not do much to address the other symptoms of the disorder and have severe and often lasting neurological side effects. Newer antipsychotics, called atypical antipsychotics, are more effective at reducing symptoms, although some of them still have the potential to cause serious side effects.

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why does medication have to be taken as directed?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Medications used to treat mental illness are very powerful and affect the body and mind in significant ways. It is very important to consult with your doctor if you are having side effects that may cause you to reduce or discontinue your medication. Side effects can sometimes be reduced or eliminated by adjusting doses or switching to a different medication. Discontinuing medications can be very dangerous when done without a doctor's supervision</Content>

<Content id="0">Medications that treat mental illnesses can have side effects, some of them severe enough to make people stop taking medications that are helping them cope with symptoms.

It is important to discuss side effects with your doctor before discontinuing or cutting back on medication because many symptoms can be reduced or eliminated with dosage adjustments or changing medications.

Discontinuing medications suddenly can potentially cause very serious withdrawal effects and should never be attempted without your doctor's approval.</Content>

<Content id="0">Program of Assertive Community Treatment, or PACT is an intensive, multidisciplinary team that helps people who live with persistent mental illness, including co-occurring substance abuse, stay healthy and out of hospitals and jails.
They are available for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for at-home support at whatever level is needed, and for whatever problems that need to be solved. Rather than referring consumers to fragmented services, the PACT staff directly provides psychiatric, rehabilitation, substance abuse treatment, crisis intervention, peer support, and other support services.

Symptom relief through pharmaceutical or holistic interventions
Psychological support for rebuilding the resiliency often lost with mental illness
Social, educational and vocational support for re-entry into work, school and family life

An ideal treatment plan utilizes a combination of evidence-based practices--or treatment that is supported by scientific evidence, as well as carefully considered expert opinion and is consistent with the consumer and caregiver's personal values.</Content>

<Content id="0">The human body is a single organism comprised of many parts working together as one, with each part affecting and being affected by others. This means that while mental illnesses may involve chemical imbalances in the brain, the rest of the body can be affected as well. Mood and brain function are impacted by what we eat and drink, how much or how little exercise we get, the music we listen to and even the color of our walls! Sleep and mental health are closely related as well. Explore the links to the left to learn more about how mental and physical health are interrelated.</Content>

It takes vigilance, planning and a strong support system.  Many people use a Wellness Recovery Action Plan to help them stay in recovery.  Others refer to their Recovery Toolbox, an informal list of things that help keep them on track and instructions on how to find their way again should they encounter difficulties.  Listen to the experiences of these individuals in recovery and look in the Resource Area for information on Recovery tools and WRAP plans.</Content>

Support groups for consumers and family members can be a source of support from people who are experiencing the same things.

Drop in centers organize social events and provide a place where consumers can go to interact with others.</Content>

<Content id="0">People with serious mental illness often struggle to maintain consistent employment and can find themselves with reduced earning power and sometimes without any income altogether. There are resources available to those who have a serious mental illness who have been unable to find adequate employment.

Case Management services assist consumers with enrolling in financial assistance programs, including those that provide representative payee services, emergency housing, utility payments, rent subsidies and drug rehabilitation expenses.

Government Social Security programs like SSI and SSDI, and food stamps are available to those who qualify. To learn about the financial support available in your state and community and how to apply for it, contact your local Social Security Administration  field office. There are links to agencies and sites in the Resource Area.

People coping with illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder often need help with the complicated process of applying for the money they're entitled to receive.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Can people who have a mental illness work?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">People with mental illness can and do work! For many people who live with mental illness, having meaningful work is a vital step toward wellness.

After a mental health crisis, it can be difficult to re-enter the workforce and the nature of some mental illnesses make it difficult to maintain steady employment. Volunteering can be a good way to gain skills and do something that contributes to living a purposeful life.

There are many vocational services that help individuals in recovery find and keep a job. Vocational programs may offer social, vocational, housing, and other services and may provide work on-site for members, as well as transitional-employment programs to support them as they re-enter the competitive work force.

Supported employment helps individuals to learn marketable work skills at a real job of their choosing.

For example, Fountain House uses the Clubhouse Model of Vocational Rehabilitation to help individuals  operate a kitchen, administrative offices, housekeeping services, and programs in education, research, financial management, and other employment opportunities.

A transitional-employment program helps members learn job skills. Fountain House staff work closely with local hospitals and psychiatrists to coordinate members' medical treatment and assist when a crisis occurs.

The Mental Health Pathway programs train consumers and family members to work in the mental health field.

For more information on these and other vocational programs, look in the Resource Area of this page.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is Social Security?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Government programs can provide financial support to those who cannot work due to serious mental illness.

SSI or Supplemental Security Income is a federal program that provides income to those who are aged, blind, or disabled.  Eligibility is based on financial need and disability determination.  State Social Security programs may also provide small amounts of aid.

SSDI or Social Security Disability Insurance, is for disabled workers who have paid into the Social Security system through payroll deductions. Some disabled persons under age 22 may collect SSDI under a parent's account if the parent is retired, disabled, or deceased.

GPA or General Public Assistance, is available in some locations to those who are disabled and either ineligible or waiting for other assistance.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The Federal Americans with Disabilities Act requires that all people have a fair chance to work. The Act prevents businesses with 15 or more employees from discriminating against a qualified candidate on the basis of a disability, including mental illness.

Reasonable accommodations must be made for people with disabilities to help them be more productive at work. One advantage in discussing your mental illness with your employer is that it gives you legal coverage under the Americans with Disabilities Act. If you have trouble completing your work due to symptoms of your mental illness and have not told your employer about your disability, the company can take action against you for poor work performance, and you will not be protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

If you do decide to tell your employer about your mental illness it may be helpful to help educate them by providing fact sheets and information about your illness. You may also remind your employer of the reasons you were hired and show them that you are a valuable employee. If there are specific job tasks you find difficult to complete because of your mental illness, you can work with your employer to find reasonable accommodations that help you fulfill your job responsibilities.

You may also want to review your employer's policies about leave with or without pay. Asking for help from your employer can be difficult, but working together can provide benefits for both of you. By law, your employer must respect your right to privacy and offer a fair chance for you to pursue a career.

If you feel you have been discriminated against, contact your local Equal Employment Opportunity Commission office. Links to more information about the Americans with Disabilities Act are listed in the Resource section.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I return to the world of work after a crisis?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">In addition to your treatment plan, recovery may include activities that help you feel successful and productive. These activities may include hobbies, volunteer work or vocational training. Finding work in a setting that meets your personal needs can be an important part of helping you feel like a part of your community. Sometimes people need to learn new skills or relearn lost or forgotten skills. Practicing these skills in a supportive and safe place such as a drop-in center, advocacy center or Clubhouse program may be a good stepping-stone in recovery. In these places, you can work on social skills, practice working with others, follow a schedule and learn to work within your own limits and energy level. The best part of these activities is that you'll be working with others who understand what you are going through. For some people, a side effect of their illness is that they lose certain skills or cannot think as clearly or quickly as before. This  can lead to feelings of frustration or loss for those who can't easily return to their former work life. If this is the case for you, it's important to recognize those feelings. It won't happen overnight, but there are things you can do to help you prepare to return to work. Programs exist to help you find your strengths and help you successfully search for a job</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Mental Illness in Older Adults Overview</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Even if someone has never had a mental illness before, they can still be diagnosed with a treatable mental illness as an older adult.  Mental illness in older adults can be difficult to recognize.  Family members, health professionals and even older adults themselves can easily miss the symptoms or dismiss them as a normal part of aging.  Many older adults are reluctant to seek help because they are ashamed or afraid of how a diagnosis might affect their independence.

Mental illnesses that are common in older adults include depression, dementia, and anxiety.

Mental illness in older adults is treatable and with appropriate treatment many see their symptoms alleviated.  Listen as these professionals talk about mental illness in seniors then use the links to your left to explore the topic further, or type your own question into the box.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why is it difficult to diagnose mental illness in older adults?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Mental illnesses share symptoms with other age-related illnesses like heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer.  Additionally, depression can be influenced by the health issues and financial difficulties that older adults often face. Because of this, medical professionals and older adults themselves often believe that their symptoms of depression are a natural result of these worries. This, in turn, can lead to many older adults affected by mental illness going undiagnosed and untreated. It is important to become familiar with the signs of mental illness in adults and be aware of changes in mood, eating and sleeping patterns.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is depression in older adults?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Depression is considered the most common mental disorder in adults over the age of 65. The symptoms of depression, especially trouble concentrating, confusion, memory issues and irritability or worry, are often thought to be a normal part of aging or the onset of dementia. In fact, some experts believe that up to 10 percent of those diagnosed with dementia actually have depression. Be aware of changes in mood or eating and sleeping habits, uncharacteristic irritability, anxiety, feelings of worthlessness or guilt and changes in activity levels or interest in favorite activities.

It is important to rule out other physical causes for changes in behavior because they can also signal health issues such as heart disease, problems with the thyroid and other glands or other illnesses. Medications can also cause some of the symptoms of depression so make sure to tell your doctor about behavior changes noticed after any change in medication.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is dementia?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Dementia is a brain condition that causes problems with thinking and memory. There are many different types of dementia, each of which has different causes but similar symptoms, including Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, caused by stroke or long term high blood pressure as well as dementia with Lewy bodies caused by protein deposits in the brain. Other forms of dementia are caused by long term excessive alcohol use, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. Often dementia is caused by a more than one of these disorders.

Older adults who become forgetful, disoriented or confused should be evaluated by a mental health professional and medical doctor because there are some reversible conditions that have the same symptoms as dementia. Side effects from medications, medication interactions or overdoses, poor diet and other physical illnesses can look like dementia.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is anxiety in older adults?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Doctors and older adults tend to view anxiety and fear as normal given the circumstances of aging. But developing an anxiety disorder late in life is not a normal part of aging.

Studies estimate that anxiety disorders affect between 3 and 14 percent of older adults in a given year. More women than men experience anxiety disorders. They tend to be less common among older adults than younger adults.

Anxiety caused by stressful events like moving or losing a job is a normal part of life. But anxiety disorders are different. An anxiety disorder lasts a long time and can get worse if it is not treated.

Anxiety disorders commonly occur at the same time as other illnesses. In older adults, anxiety disorders often occur at the same time as depression, heart disease, diabetes, and other medical problems. In some cases, these other illnesses need to be treated before a person will respond to treatment for the anxiety disorder.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the relationship between physical and mental illnesses in older adults?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Many of the physical illnesses common in older adults co-occur with mental illnesses like anxiety and depression.  Some of the symptoms of these common illnesses can also mimic those of mental illness or dementia.  Likewise, the side effects of medications commonly taken by older adults can have side effects that mimic those of mental illness, especially in the case of drug interactions or overdose.

Heart or lung disease can affect behavior when there is not enough oxygen getting to the brain.  Diseases of the glands, such as the thyroid, adrenal, pituitary or pancreas can cause problems regulating emotion, perception, memory and thinking.

Poor nutrition can also contribute to symptoms of mental illness in older adults.  If the body is not getting adequate nutrition, it can affect behaviors.  Too little sugar in the bloodstream can cause confusion and personality changes, while conditions like pernicious anemia, caused by problems absorbing vitamin B12, can cause irritability, depression and dementia.

Physical issues related to aging, such as dental problems can contribute to poor nutrition, and lack of exercise due to limited mobility can cause depressed mood and irritability.</Content>

<Content id="0">Treatment for mental illness in older adults is consistent with treatment for other age groups.  Medications can be effective and it is important to tell all healthcare providers about all medications and supplements to avoid drug interactions.  Side effects should be closely monitored as well.

Psychotherapy is effective as well, and a combination of medication and therapy has been shown to be very effective in reducing the recurrence of depression in older adults.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I support older adults?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are many things loved ones can do to support older adults who either have a risk of developing or are currently living with mental illness.

Loss of a loved one, loss of independence, isolation, lasting complications or pain stemming from medical conditions, economic lifestyle changes, the stress of caring for a disabled spouse, the lack of the robustness of youth, or a combination of these and other factors increase the risk of mental illness and suicide in older adults.

Inform your loved one's caregivers of any changes in behavior or mood that you see and make sure physical causes for these changes are ruled out by medical professionals.

Pay close attention to mood and provide extra support during transitions, such as changes in housing arrangements, new illness diagnoses or treatment, or changes in mobility and independence. Also, make sure that healthcare professionals are asking about suicidal ideation and monitoring mental health during these periods as well.

Take steps to ensure the senior in your life is not left bereft and feeling alone. Visit often. Interact by playing games, dining together, or simply talking. Frequent visits help determine if seniors are doing well. Interacting provides the opportunity to look for and gauge the signs listed above in an unobtrusive way. If you can't visit yourself, look into volunteer or paid services where your loved one lives to find a companion who can visit them. Some facilities have programs to keep older adults active and engaged, and there are community programs that they can take part in as well if they are living on their own.

Also you can help your older loved one stay safe from phone and internet scams by educating them on how to protect their privacy.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Mental Illness in Children and Adolescents Overview.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Children and adolescents with serious emotional or mental impairments face particular challenges, as do their parents and caregivers. Mental and emotional impairments can look different in children and adolescents than they do in adults and there are many questions about appropriate treatments and medications.

If you are a child or adolescent who has or thinks you may have an emotional or mental impairment, you are not alone. We have information and resources for you on common problems faced by others who have been where you are.

If you're a parent of a child or adolescent with emotional or mental impairment, you may be feeling overwhelmed. Parenting a child with a mental or emotional impairment means trying to navigate the mental health system and the education system all while maintaining a stable home and caring for yourself and others.

Listen to these next few videos, then continue to explore this topic by asking your own questions, or by using the links to your left.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is mental illness or severe emotional disturbance in children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">In children, severe emotional disturbance is a term that describes disorders in children and adolescents that have difficulty functioning at home or in school or community settings.  These disorders are thought to be related to underlying conditions such as mental illnesses or environmental traumas such as physical or emotional abuse or neglect, out-of-home placement, brain injury, exposure to drugs and alcohol or to violence.

13% of youth aged 8-15 live with emotional disturbance severe enough to cause significant impairment in their day-to-day lives. This figure jumps to 21% in youth aged 13-18.

50% of all lifetime cases of severe emotional disturbance begin by age 14 and 75% by age 24.

Early detection and treatment of severe emotional disturbance is important.  Research into childhood emotional disturbances has shown that intensive early treatment may in some cases lessen the effects of the disorders and, in some cases, prevent serious mental illnesses from developing altogether.  Unfortunately, the average delay between onset of symptoms and intervention is 8-10 years. Only 50% of youth with diagnosable disorders receive treatment.

As a results, approximately 50% of students aged 14 and older with a severe emotional disturbance drop out of high school--the highest dropout rate of any disability group.

70% of youth in state and local juvenile justice systems have a diagnosable emotional or mental health impairment, with at least 20% experiencing severe symptoms.

Severe emotional disturbances that affect children and adolescents include but are not limited to anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorders, childhood-onset bipolar disorder, early onset depression, early onset schizophrenia, eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder or A.D.H.D.

<BaseQuestion id="0">Who should I talk to if I think my child or adolescent may have a mental illness?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">If you think your child may have an emotional or mental impairment talk to your child's primary care doctor about your concerns, and describe what you have seen.  If they confirm your feelings that there is a concern, then you can work toward getting your child the help they need.

As part of the diagnostic process a comprehensive physical examination should be done to rule out other physical conditions that may be causing a child's symptoms.  They should also be evaluated for substance use problems, learning disabilities, sensory integration problems, and other physical or mental disorders, that may cause behavioral problems or poor school performance.    You can also ask your child's school to do diagnostic testing to help with a diagnosis.

Once other causes for concerning behavior have been ruled out a mental health provider that specializes in childhood mental illness should be consulted. Your child's primary care physician may be able to refer you to a mental health professional.    To find a child psychiatrist, visit the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry website.  The link is listed in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What can I do to support my child?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">You can support your child or adolescent by helping them find an accurate diagnosis and effective treatments.
Getting an accurate diagnosis takes time and can be a frustrating process for the individual and family.  During this process it is important to focus on finding effective interventions to address the individual's symptoms.

If emotional or mental illness interferes with a child's education, schools are required to provide special education and related services in the school setting.  Families and teachers should work together to find effective interventions, accommodations, and supports that promote positive behaviors, academic achievement, and prevent challenging behaviors in school.

For some children, having a diagnosis is scary and they may be resistant to accept it.  Others are relieved to know that what is happening to them is caused by an illness, that they are not alone, and that there are treatment options that can make them feel and do better.

 It is important to find ways to use the strengths and interests of your child to help him or her cope with difficult symptoms. Activities like exercise, martial arts, music, and art can be extremely beneficial.   Ask your child's mental health professional to recommend effective interventions, skills training, support groups, and other options that can help your child cope with symptoms and develop the skills necessary to ultimately lead a full and productive life.

You can also support your child by educating yourself about mental illness.

<BaseQuestion id="0">Is medication use safe for children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There has been much concern about the use of psychotropic medications or medications to treat mental illness.  Little research has been done about the long term effects of these medications.

Psychotropic medications for young children should be used only when anticipated benefits outweigh risks. Parents should be fully informed and decisions made only after carefully weighing these factors. Children and adolescents must be closely monitored and frequently evaluated as the side effects common to some medications can be particularly difficult for children. At the same time, psychotropic medications can be lifesaving.

Medications are only part of a treatment plan which affects the biological causes of mental illness.  Even with medication mental illness can continue to affect an individual's life so it is important to address the psychological and social aspects of mental illness as well.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the treatments for mental illness in children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Effective treatment for mental illness should address all effects of the illness, including the biological, psychological and social aspects.  This biopsychosocial form of treatment provides a comprehensive plan that addresses all areas of functioning.

Treatment for children and adolescents with mental illness or severe emotional disturbance is often provided in the school setting as part of an individualized education plan or IEP.   Behaviors that interfere with learning are addressed with positive behavioral interventions, strategies, and supports. Psychological or counseling services may also be provided through the school as part of the IEP.

Psychological treatments work by helping people with mental illness understand their illness and by teaching them how to deal with stress and unhealthy thoughts and behaviors.  Activities like sports or physical exercise such as martial arts, music or art are recommended to help build on the strengths and interests of your child and to help him or her cope with difficult symptoms.  A healthy diet, regular exercise and adequate sleep are also an important part of treatment.

Medication may be part of a child or adolescent's treatment plan, but because the effects of psychotropic medications on still developing brains are unknown, some people are hesitant to consider them as a first line treatment.  Be sure to discuss medication use with your child's mental healthcare provider.</Content>

<Content id="0">All medications, even aspirin, have side effects.  When medications are prescribed it is important to understand all of the potential benefits and risks of the medication, as well as options for alternative or complementary treatments.

It is also important to understand how the medication works, and how long it takes for it to be affective.

Determining the best dose of a medication and whether it is effective requires close observation by the prescriber, the individual taking the medication and family or others who are in a position to observe behaviors such as teachers.

For this reason it is important to schedule follow up visits within two weeks of starting the medication and monthly until symptoms are improved and stabilized.

If a child or adolescent has taken medications to treat mental illness over an extended period of time and they are doing better, it is important to cautiously try to decrease the medication to the lowest effective amount.  This process should be managed by a doctor.  It is important not to suddenly stop taking a medication because this can cause serious adverse effects.  Talk to your child's doctor before making any changes to medication.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are anxiety disorders in children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Anxiety disorders are a group of disorders that cause people to feel excessively frightened, distressed, and uneasy during situations in which most others would not experience these symptoms. They are the most common mental illnesses in America affecting as many as one in 10 young people.

Left untreated Anxiety disorders in children can lead to poor school attendance, low self-esteem, deficient interpersonal skills, alcohol abuse, and adjustment difficulty.

There are several types of anxiety disorders common in children and adolescents:

Panic disorder is characterized by panic attacks sudden feelings of terror that strike repeatedly and without warning. Symptoms can include chest pain, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, abdominal discomfort, feelings of unreality, and fear of dying. Children and adolescents with this disorder may experience unrealistic worry, self- consciousness, and tension.

Post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD is caused by trauma such as emotional or physical abuse or neglect, exposure to violence, or other traumatic experiences. Symptoms include nightmares, flashbacks, the numbing of emotions, depression, feeling angry, irritable, and distracted; and being easily startled.

Generalized anxiety disorder is described as exaggerated worry about every day, routine life events and activities that lasts at least six months or more. Children and adolescents with this disorder usually anticipate the worst and may also complain of fatigue, tension, headaches, and nausea.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Autism spectrum disorders are a group of disorders that interrupt childhood development, resulting in problems with communication, social skills stereotyped or repetitive behaviors and interests, sensory issues, and in some cases, cognitive delays.  Its characteristic symptoms include awkwardness in social situations, intense preoccupation with specific, often unusual topics, lack of understanding of social cues, an extreme need for routine and structure, and clumsiness caused by lack of motor coordination.

The autism spectrum disorders include autism, Asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders or PDD.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is childhood onset bipolar disorder?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Individuals with bipolar disorder experience mood swings that alternate from periods of severe highs called mania to the severe lows of depression.  However, while these abnormally intense moods usually last for weeks or months in adults, children with bipolar disorder can experience such rapid mood swings that they commonly cycle many times within a day. The most typical pattern of cycling among children with bipolar disorder is called ultra-ultra rapid or ultradian.  This cycle features low energy in the mornings followed by increases in energy towards late afternoon or evening.

Many parents report that their children have seemed different since early infancy. They describe difficulty settling their babies, and they note that their children are easily over-responsive to sensory stimulation. Sleep disturbances and night terrors are also commonly reported.

Children having a manic episode commonly

Feel very happy or act silly in a way that's unusual
Have a very short temper
Talk really fast about a lot of different things
Have trouble sleeping without feeling tired
Have trouble staying focused
Talk and think about sex more often
Do risky things.

Children and teens having a depressive episode may:

Feel very sad
Complain about pain a lot, like stomachaches and headaches
Sleep too little or too much
Feel guilty and worthless
Eat too little or too much
Have little energy and no interest in fun activities
Think about death or suicide</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a dual diagnosis of mental illness and substance abuse in children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Many teens with mental illness attempt to self-medicate with street drugs and alcohol.  In fact, the combination of mental illness and substance abuse is so common that many clinicians now expect to find it.  Studies show that more than half of young persons with a substance abuse diagnosis also have a diagnosable mental illness. Families and caregivers know how difficult it is to find treatment for an adolescent who abuses drugs or alcohol but also is diagnosed with a mental illness.

Traditionally, programs that treat individuals with brain disorders do not treat individuals with active substance abuse problems, and programs for substance abusers are not geared for people with mental illness. Adolescents are often caught in this treatment or services gap.

Treatment for mental illness is more effective when there is no substance use involved, however, new treatment models integrate mental health and substance use treatment.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is early onset depression?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Children, and especially adolescents experience normal mood swings in reaction to things around them.  But depression is more than the sadness over a bad day or the normal cycle of coping that we all experience with major loss such as the death of a love one or pet.

Depression is a brain disorder that affects the whole person--it affects the way one feels, thinks, and acts. Early onset depression can lead to school failure, alcohol or other drug use, and even suicide. However, it is highly treatable.

Signs of depression in children and adolescents include

Persistent sadness and hopelessness
Withdrawal from friends and from activities once enjoyed
Increased irritability or agitation
Missed school or poor school performance
Changes in eating and sleeping habits
Indecision, lack of concentration, or forgetfulness
Poor self-esteem or guilt
Frequent physical complaints, such as headaches and stomachaches
Lack of enthusiasm, low energy, or low motivation
Drug or alcohol abuse
Thoughts of death or suicide

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is early onset schizophrenia?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that interferes with thinking and perceptions.  The main feature of schizophrenia is psychosis or losing touch with reality.   Symptoms of schizophrenia usually begin in late adolescence or early adulthood; schizophrenia with an onset prior to age 18 is less common, and onset of the disorder before age 13 is exceedingly rare.

Diagnosing schizophrenia in children can be difficult for several reasons.  The early symptoms emerge gradually and may be attributed to typical developmental stages, other mental illnesses or developmental delays.

An additional difficulty in making a diagnosis in children and adolescents relates to the fact that hallucinations, one of the hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia, are surprisingly common, and, in fact, are most often seen in children and adolescents with diagnoses other than schizophrenia.  Many children with other conditions such as mood disorders and dissociative disorders, report auditory hallucinations when they are under stress.

Children with autism spectrum disorders such as autism or Asperger's disorder, often have social difficulties, disorganized behavior and language impairments, and can be misdiagnosed as having schizophrenia.

If your child has any of the following symptoms, you should consult a medical professional.  Having one or more these symptoms does not mean that your child has schizophrenia; it only means that an evaluation should be done to determine if there is a diagnosable condition that can be treated.

In younger children:
Language delays
Late or unusual crawling
Late walking
Other abnormal motor behaviors -- for example, rocking or arm flapping are signs that a child should be evaluated

In older children and adolescents:
Withdrawal from friends and family
A drop in performance at school
Trouble sleeping
Irritability or depressed mood
Lack of motivation
Strange eating rituals
Shows excessive suspicion of others
Shows a lack of emotion or shows emotions inappropriate for the situation
Has strange ideas and fears
or, has violent or aggressive behavior or agitation

Seek medical attention immediately if you notice your child

Delusions, or beliefs not based on reality
Hallucinations or seeing or hearing things that don't exist, especially voices
Disorganized or illogical thinking
Speech that doesn't make sense</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are eating disorders in children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Eating disorders are characterized by preoccupation with food and weight issues.  Although many people want to be thin and take healthy steps to lose weight, people with eating disorders focus on these issues so much that other areas of their life are negatively affected.  Without treatment, eating disorders can lead to serious, potentially fatal medical complications. Although eating disorders are commonly associated with women, men can develop them as well.  The three main types of eating disorders are:

Anorexia nervosa, which involves denying oneself food to the point of self-starvation. A person with anorexia nervosa may deny they are hungry and refuse to eat, or they may vomit or use laxatives to purge after eating or exercise until they are exhausted to burn calories.

People with bulimia nervosa binge eat large amounts of food over a short time, and then vomit, use laxatives or excessive exercise to rid themselves of the calories.

Binge Eating Disorder or B.E.D. is losing control over eating habits and continuing to eat even when one is uncomfortably full. This excessive overeating leads to embarrassment, depressed or guilty feelings. Unlike anorexia or bulimia nervosa, a person with B.E.D. does not attempt to purge or exercise excessively after eating.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD is a disorder that causes recurring and stressful thoughts, fears or images called obsessions.  In an attempt to calm the anxiety and stop the obsessive thoughts from the obsessions, people with OCD perform specific actions or routines called compulsions.

Examples of obsessions are "My hands must be contaminated; I have to wash them" or "I know I left the stove on" or even "I'm going to hurt myself." To some extent, people with OCD know that their obsessions irrational but they cannot shake the anxiety that the obsessions produce.

Compulsions may be excessive and repeated hand washing, counting things, checking and rechecking, hoarding, or arranging.  People with OCD feel they must perform these compulsive rituals or something bad will happen. The onset of OCD symptoms may occur as early as age three or four, but very young children and parents may not recognize the symptoms.  OCD effects children and adolescents during a very important period of social development. Schoolwork, home life, and friendships are often affected.

Some children with OCD are too young to realize that their thoughts and actions are unusual. They may not understand or be unable to explain why they must go through their rituals. But older children may feel embarrassed and may hide their rituals when in front of friends at school or at home and become mentally exhausted from the strain.  Some may find their rituals so time-consuming that they are too tired to play with friends or concentrate in school. OCD in children often exists concurrently with motor tics or Tourette's syndrome.

Approximately one million children and adolescents in the United States suffer from OCD. This can mean three to five youngsters with OCD per average-sized elementary school and about 20 teenagers in a large high school.  OCD is as or more prevalent than many other, better known childhood ailments.</Content>

<Content id="0">Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, is an illness characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.

There are different types of ADHD:

Those with the predominantly inattentive type often fail to pay close attention to details or make careless mistakes in schoolwork, work, or other activities; have difficulty sustaining  attention to tasks or leisure activities; do not seem to listen when spoken to directly; do not follow through on instructions and fail to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace; have difficulty organizing tasks and activities; avoid, dislike, or are reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort; lose things necessary for tasks or activities; are easily distracted by extraneous stimuli; are forgetful in daily activities.

Those with the predominantly hyperactive or impulsive type often: fidget with their hands or feet or squirm in their seat; leave their seat in situations in which remaining seated is expected; move  excessively or feel restless during situations in which such behavior is inappropriate; have difficulty engaging in leisure activities  quietly; are "on the go" or act as if "driven by a motor"; talk excessively;  blurt out answers before questions have been completed; have difficulty awaiting their  turn; interrupt or intrude on others.

Those with the combined type, the most common type of ADHD, have a combination of the inattentive and hyperactive or impulsive symptoms.

<Content id="0">If you feel that your child is in danger, call 911 immediately.  Suicide is a serious concern in children and adolescents and having a mental illness does increase the risk of suicide.   For youth between the ages of 10 and 24, suicide is the third leading cause of death. It results in approximately 4600 lives lost each year. The top three methods used in suicides of young people include firearm, suffocation, and poisoning.

Parents and caregivers should be aware of the risk factors which include

History of previous suicide attempts
Family history of suicide
History of depression or other mental illness
Alcohol or drug abuse
Stressful life event or loss
Easy access to lethal methods
Exposure to the suicidal behavior of others
Incarceration

Parents and caregivers should also be aware that there are protective factors that reduce risk of suicide as well, including

Skills in problem solving, conflict resolution and handling problems in a non-violent way
Strong connections to family, friends, and community support
Restricted access to highly lethal means of suicide
Cultural and religious beliefs that discourage suicide and support easy access to a variety of clinical interventions
Effective clinical care for mental, physical, and substance use disorders
Support through ongoing medical and mental health care relationships</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How do I talk to my child about suicide?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are things you can do to reduce the risk of suicide.

If you believe that someone you know may be thinking about harming themselves, talk to them.  Talking to a friend or family member about suicidal thoughts and feelings can be extremely difficult, but don't be afraid to ask directly whether or not they are thinking of hurting themselves.  You cannot make a person suicidal by showing that you care. In fact, giving a suicidal person the opportunity to express his or her feelings can provide relief from loneliness and pent-up negative feelings, and may prevent a suicide attempt.

Talk in a calm, non-accusatory manner
Let them know you love and care for them
Convey how important they are to you
Focus on concern for their well-being
Make statements that convey you have empathy for their stress
Encourage seeking professional help
Reassure them that they will not feel like this forever</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Is it safe for my child with mental illness to use the internet?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Parents are often concerned about the impact of the internet on their child's well-being.  One of the issues involves misinformation--how do you make sure your child is getting accurate information?  Another concern is the effect of chat rooms and whether their use encourages individuals to get help or may possibly encourage harmful actions.  Cyberbullying is also of great concern, as is the social isolation that some believe the internet promotes.

As with any new technology, there are both pros and cons.

Individuals who access information about their condition from reliable sources on the internet are more likely to seek help from mental health professionals.

Many express that they have found a social network through social media that they are not able to find outside the internet.

The most important thing is to talk to kids about their internet use and make it part of the discussion about their mental health.  Point them to sites with accurate health information and discussion sites that are moderated by professionals.    Acknowledge that there is harmful information on the internet and talk about what to do if they encounter someone who is bullying them or advocating harmful behaviors.

Look in the Resource Area for more information on internet use and mental health as well as information on safe internet use for children, using parental controls, and protecting privacy on social media.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is an individualized education plan (IEP)?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">An Individualized Education Plan, also called an IEP, is a written contract with the school district stating the plan that will be followed to educate your child once the child has been evaluated and determined to have a disability that interferes with their education, such as a severe emotional disturbance or mental illness.

The IEP should be reviewed at a meeting that includes parents. This plan should include a description of all special education services your child will be receiving, yearly goals, and transition plans for adolescents who have reached age 16.

Special education services for youth with emotional or mental impairment may also include psychological or counseling services.

Requests for an IEP from your child's school district must be in writing.  Look for links to more information on this subject in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Where can I find community services for children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Services for children and adolescents whose education is affected by emotional disturbance or mental illness are provided through Individualized Education Plans or IEPs in the school environment.

If a child does not have an IEP, community services for children and adolescents with mental illness are provided through the Children Youth and Families area of Behavioral Health Services or CYF.  This agency offers a wide variety of services, from early intervention to residential services, through direct, county-operated agencies, and through contracts with community-based providers and individual fee-for-service providers.  For more information on mental health services available for children and adolescents, look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a conservatorship?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A mental health conservatorship, called an LPS conservatorship names a family member or other adult as caregiver for an adult who cannot take care of themselves due to serious mental illness.  The caregiver is then called the conservator.

The conservator has the duty to take care of and protect the person with mental illness and to make financial decisions for them.  The conservator can give consent to mental health treatment, including the use of medications used to treat mental illness, but the person with mental illness may still physically refuse to take the medications.

The conservator can also agree to place the person with mental illness in a locked facility if a psychiatrist says it is needed and the hospital agrees to take the person.

The Court will not let you establish an LPS conservatorship unless it finds beyond a reasonable doubt, that the person is gravely disabled. Gravely disabled means that, because of a mental disorder, the person cannot take care of basic, personal needs for food, clothing, or shelter.

An LPS conservatorship only lasts one year. About 90 days before it expires, the LPS clerk in the Probate Court Clerk's Office will mail the conservator a notice of expiration.  If you need to, you can petition to renew the conservatorship. Otherwise, it will end. This means that the adult with mental illness is free to make their own decisions, and to refuse treatment.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How is mental illness diagnosed in children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Mental illness diagnoses are made based on professional observation and evaluation, information provided by your family and other experts, and the criteria found in the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This evaluation should include a comprehensive look at all aspects of your child's life in school, with family, with friends, and in the community.   The provider evaluating your child is likely to ask you to fill out a checklist that provides a detailed profile of your child and the challenges your child is facing.

It may take several visits with a mental health professional before a diagnosis is made.  The diagnosis may also change as new symptoms emerge or existing symptoms change. A diagnosis must be confirmed over time and thus ongoing two-way communication between the treating provider and the family is necessary to track and monitor the child's condition and progress.   Families should not hesitate to seek a second opinion if they are not confident in their child's evaluation and the diagnostic process.  Getting a second opinion can be challenging because of the shortage of children's mental health providers.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the difference between ADHD and childhood onset bipolar disorder?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Childhood Onset Bipolar Disorder or COBPD is a mood disorder that is sometimes mistaken for ADHD.  The differences in children who have childhood onset bipolar disorder are subtle. Destructive behaviors are common to both disorders but these behaviors often seem intentional in those with COBPD and caused more by carelessness or inattention in those with ADHD.

Physical outbursts and temper tantrums, also features of both disorders, are triggered by sensory and emotional over-stimulation in those with ADHD, but can be triggered by limit-setting, or even a simple "No" from parents of those with COBPD.

Furthermore, while those with ADHD seem to calm down after such outbursts within 15 to 30 minutes, those with COBPD often continue to feel angry, sometimes for hours. It is important to note that children with COBPD are often remorseful following temper tantrums and express that they are unable to control their anger.

Other symptoms, such as irritability and sleep disturbances, often accompanied by night terrors with morbid, life-threatening content, are commonly seen in those with COBPD but are rarely associated with ADHD.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What do I do if a peer of my child commits suicide?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The suicide of a friend or peer is often a traumatic experience for adolescents and the death of one teen might influence other teens feeling suicidal.   The suicide of a well-known celebrity or personal idol can have a similar influence on depressed young people.

Talk to your child about what happened and emphasize the dangerous consequences of the deceased's behavior and about the importance of seeking help.  Ask them who they would go to if they had a serious problem, but don't be upset if you aren't on the top of the list.  Provide suggestions for others they may go to--family members, school staff or other trusted adults.  Above all, make sure that they understand the importance of sharing problems and getting help.

Keep the lines of communication open and check back with your child periodically to see if they have any unasked questions or concerns; and be aware of the risk factors and warning signs of suicide.

For more information on how to talk to your child about the suicide of a peer, look in the Resource Area of this page.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Does online therapy work?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Technology is making great changes in treatment for mental illness. Individuals can now receive therapy from a licensed professional via the web, live chats or email. There are applications that support Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, track bipolar mood episodes and even virtual reality simulations which aim to provide controlled exposure therapy to those with anxiety disorders.

The effectiveness of these technologies is still being examined, but if they are proven to be effective, they may open the door to more accessible treatment for people with mental illness.

When exploring online treatments, look for reputable providers and discuss the options with your mental health professional.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I better communicate with my loved one?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Many mental illnesses come with cognitive overload, or the inability to think clearly, which makes it difficult for everyone to communicate with each other.  We fall into ineffective patterns of communicating around the symptoms of mental illness.  In order to communicate effectively, we need to state our needs and concerns openly and we need to allow our loved one to do the same.

Two communication methods are especially helpful in restoring healthy communications among family members and loved ones with mental illness.

"I" statements express clearly and directly how you feel or think or what you want.  They put the focus on the speaker and dispel tones of judgment and blame that can be heard in statements that begin with "You".

Reflective statements mirror back to the person the emotions they are expressing.  For instance if a person says that they don't want to take their medication because it causes weight gain, you might reflect back "I can see why it would bother you to be putting on more weight."   After letting your loved one know that you are listening and can empathize with their feelings, it is much easier to discuss the problems they are having and to come up with solutions that meet everyone's needs.

Family-to-Family class members learn about communication skills and role play conversations.  For more information on communication skills, look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can families solve problems as a team?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">When a family member has a mental illness, the rest of the family is faced with a myriad of problems that seem to have no solutions.  The sheer volume and repetitiveness of the issues can be overwhelming.  The key to problem solving is  first agree on what the main problem is, to define it clearly, and then to brainstorm solutions with others.   It is often helpful to enlist members of other families in this exercise to learn from their experiences.

NAMI's Family-to-Family class features a problem-solving workshop that demonstrates a model that can be used to structure problem-solving discussions.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What keeps people from seeking treatment?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">One of the most heartbreaking dilemmas facing the families of people with mental illness occurs when their loved one refuses to get treatment.

There are many reasons why people with serious mental illness refuse treatment. People who are symptomatic may not even realize that they have a mental illness. Another reason is the stigma of being a person with a mental illness. Mental illness is often seen as a weakness or failure, sometimes even by individuals with mental illness themselves. This keeps people from acknowledging that they are ill and from accepting the help they need to feel better. Side effects from psychotropic medications can be serious, and that, in the eyes of the person who is taking them, outweigh the benefits.

As family members or caregivers, we can learn to empathize with our loved one's reasons for refusing treatment and can work with them to reduce stigma and to find better medications with fewer side effects.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why does my loved one continue to have behavioral difficulties even after treatment?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">As would anyone whose sense of stability and safety has been shattered, people who have a mental illness can act in ways that seem baffling to family and friends, but make perfect sense for someone who is trying to preserve what sense of self they have left.

These behaviors, called defensive coping strategies, are used by all of us at times, but for people whose sense of self is always at risk due to mental illness, they can become standard behavior.

Recovery is a process that takes time and support.  People in recovery are learning more positive coping skills but may at times fall back on defensive coping strategies.   Understanding the pain underlying these actions can help family, caregivers and friends better respond to them.   Continued therapeutic support as well as the support of friends and family can help individuals with mental illness in their recovery.

Defensive coping strategies include:

Self-absorption
Irritability
Haughtiness
Controlling/manipulation
Anger and attack
Rejection of friends and family
Blaming others
Defensiveness
Drug and alcohol abuse
Doing nothing
Resistance to change
Refusing services
Denial
Apathy
Suspicion
Dependency
Abusive criticism of others
And avoidance, or "I don't want to talk about it."

NAMI's Family-to-Family class helps families and caregivers better understand the lived experience of their loved ones with mental illness.  For more information on this and other programs, look in the Resource Area.</Content>

Difficultly concentrating
Social withdrawal
Saying or doing irrational or inappropriate things
Neglecting personal care
Discontinuing medication
Unhealthy changes in sleeping or eating patterns

<BaseQuestion id="0">How does having a loved one with mental illness affect family members and caregivers?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">As family members, caregivers or friends of someone who has been diagnosed with mental illness, we go through an emotional reaction to learning about their diagnosis that is not unlike the reaction to losing a loved one.  We may feel grief and denial at first, then become angry or feel guilty, and finally we come to acceptance and understanding.  These reactions are normal and it is important to be able to express these emotions to others in a safe, non-judgmental environment.  Family support groups can be a great place to find others who have been through what you're going through.  Understanding our own emotional reactions and the reactions of others can help family members better support each other and their ill loved one.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why won't my child take medication?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Just like adults, children and adolescents may balk at taking psychotropic medications, and for the same reasons.  Many are troubled by the side effects or don't like the way the medication makes them feel.  For others, taking medication for a mental illness means that they are sick, different, or crazy.  This is self-stigma and it keeps many people from getting help.

The question of whether you can force your child to take medication is a difficult one.  Forcing a struggling child to take any medicine can lead to vomiting or choking.  Hiding medication in food or drink can destroy trust.

Talk to your child about their refusal to take medication and find out what their objections are.  Addressing the underlying issues or side effects, either with different dosages, different medications, or other avenues can help.   Sometimes making the case for medication to treat specific issues that are not necessarily related to mental illness, like sleep or appetite problems, can help as well.

Additionally, your child's treatment provider may be able to provide additional strategies to help ensure your child takes their medication as prescribed.</Content>

<Content id="0">After you have asked your school district to evaluate your child, you should be notified when the tests are complete and the school psychologist is prepared to share the findings. The results should be reviewed at an evaluation team meeting, which you must be invited to attend. The evaluation report will indicate if your child needs special education. It may also recommend the types of programs and services your child needs. Under the law, if it is determined that your child is eligible for special education services, those services must be provided at public expense, and under public supervision and direction from highly qualified teachers. Keep in mind, however, that the report may indicate that your child is ineligible and does not need a special education program.  You may have the right to appeal this decision.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is stigma?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Stigma is viewing someone in a negative way because they have an illness or condition.  For people with mental illness and their families stigma is everywhere--it can even come from ourselves.

Stigma is when our loved ones with mental illness are excluded from social activities, job opportunities, and education.  It is in the media where people with mental illness are portrayed as violent criminals.  It is in the social services system that is ill-equipped to meet the needs of people with mental illness.

And stigma is when people with mental illness don't want to get treatment or take medication because they believe these negative views themselves.  Or, when family members blame themselves for a loved one's mental illness.

There is much you can do to help fight stigma.  For more information look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is recovery language?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Language is important.  How we speak about mental illness can dispel stigma and stereotypes or reinforce them.  Recovery language is person focused, putting the emphasis on the person and their strengths rather than their illness.  For instance, we use the phrase "individuals with mental illness" rather than mentally ill individuals.  We talk about a person having schizophrenia rather than a "schizophrenic person."   When talking about symptoms we talk about what the person is experiencing, so rather than saying that someone is delusional, we say they are having delusions.  For a guide to using recovery focused language, look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I help support my loved one with mental illness?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Individuals with mental illness describe three ways that family and other caregivers can best help them.

First, learn about the illness. Understanding the lived experience of our love ones with mental illness helps us to put their behaviors and struggles in perspective.

Second, help them get effective treatment and social supports.  Often individuals with mental illness do not have the energy or focus that is sometimes needed to navigate insurance companies, medical systems and social services We can help them by advocating for them and tracking down available resources. This can be especially challenging when we don't agree with our loved ones on what treatment is appropriate.  At times, our loved ones may not be able to act in their own best interest and there may even be times when your loved one's life depends on getting them treatment against their will.

And third, listen to their concerns and feelings with an open mind. Withhold judgment and advice, unless it is asked for, and give them the time and space to recuperate, and rebuild their life.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What should I do if my loved one won't accept help?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">It can be extremely frustrating for families and caregivers when they and their loved one with mental illness do not agree on a treatment plan. Some people with mental illness have difficulty following a recommended treatment plan, whether due to the side effects of medication, stigma, or even denial or lack of awareness about their illness.

This is especially difficult when our loved one's treatment choices lead to relapse or crisis.  In these situations, caregivers may need to make difficult but life-saving decisions about their loved one's care and treatment.

Family members should not give up hope. Studies show that people with mental illness who have strong support systems, including family members, have greater success in their recovery efforts. But you also have to make sure that your own needs are being met. Always remember to  balance your advocacy for your loved one with acts of loving kindness for yourself to avoid the risk of caregiver burn out.

Look in the Resource Area for suggestions on self-care to prevent caregiver burn out.</Content>

<Content id="0">Everyone benefits from a healthy diet, but it can be especially important to individuals with mental illness.  What we eat affects our energy level, brain functioning and mood.  A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and seafood; and low in processed, refined foods optimizes mind-body health.   Some people also benefit from supplements such as B-vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids.

<Content id="0">Exercise is extremely beneficial for mental health, and in fact may be considered one of the most effective non-pharmaceutical treatments for depression.

Not only does physical exercise improve brain functioning, reduce depression and anxiety, it has other beneficial effects.

Individuals living with mental illness often have a higher risk for medical illnesses such as heart disease, obesity,  and diabetes.  Exercise can help prevent these conditions.

And exercise doesn't need to be strenuous to be beneficial.  Studies have shown that movement of any kind can be very effective, even if it is only for a few minutes a few times each week.</Content>

<Content id="0">Lack of sleep has a profound effect on the brain. Sleepiness slows down thought processing, impairs memory, makes learning difficult, and slows reaction times.

But most importantly, it affects mood, causing irritability and anger, and one's ability to cope with stress. Sleepiness also interferes with activities that improve wellness, like exercise and relaxation. If fact, chronic sleepiness puts you at greater risk for depression.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What medical disorders can co-occur with mental illness?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">When a person has two or more illnesses at the same time, it is called comorbidity.  Mental and physical illnesses are often co-morbid.  More than 68 percent of adults with a mental disorder have at least one medical condition as well.

It is important to consider comorbid disorders because they lead to increased symptoms, decreased day-to-day functionality, decreased length and quality of life and increased healthcare costs. The connection between comorbid conditions is complex--medical disorders may lead to mental disorders, mental conditions increase risk for some medical disorders, and mental and medical disorders may share common risk factors.

Holistic models that treat the whole patient, mind and body, have been shown to provide the most effective treatment for comorbid physical and mental conditions.</Content>

<Content id="0">Metabolic syndrome is a group of related conditions; increased blood pressure, a high blood sugar level, excess body fat around the waist and abnormal cholesterol levels.  Having these conditions together greatly increases your risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.

Individuals with mental illness could be at increased risk for metabolic syndrome for many reasons, including poverty and reduced access to medical care.  Metabolic syndrome is also a side effect of some medications used to treat mental illness, such as some antipsychotic drugs.

For this reason, individuals with mental illness and healthcare providers should be aware of the risks of metabolic syndrome and make treatment plans accordingly.</Content>

In peer support programs, individuals with mental illness who have achieved significant recovery, called peer support specialists, assist others with mental illness in their recovery. Along with other trained professionals, peer support specialists act as role models and provide support and information. Research shows that individuals who participate in peer support programs have more successful and longer lasting recovery experiences. Peer support programs incorporated into state and local mental health programming reduce hospitalizations and emergency interventions.</Content>

<Content id="0">Family-to-Family is a free 12 week course taught by trained family members of individuals living with mental illness. It provides critical information and strategies related to care-giving through read-alongs,  presentations, discussion and exercises. The Family-to-Family course was designated an Evidence Based Practice in 2013 by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The study conducted by the National Institutes of Mental Health showed that Family-to-Family participants had:

- Significantly greater overall empowerment as well as empowerment within their family, the service system and their community;
- greater knowledge of mental illness;
- a higher rating of coping skills;
- lower ratings of anxiety related to being able to control conditions; and
- higher reported levels of problem-solving skills related to family functioning.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How does mental illness affect men and women differently?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are many differences in how mental illness affects men and women. Depression, anxiety, personality disorders and substance abuse occur and are diagnosed at different rates in men and women. Men and women with the same condition may have very different symptoms and experiences, and they may deal with their symptoms differently. An individual's gender may also determine what access they have to mental health treatment and the types of treatment they receive.

For instance, men and women tend to deal with anxiety differently, which results in different rates of diagnosis. Women more often internalize stress, leading to withdrawal, loneliness and depression. Men are more likely to externalize stress, which results in aggressive, impulsive, coercive and noncompliant behavior.

Men with depression may feel irritable and tired and they may have more trouble sleeping than women with depression. They are also less likely to seek help for their symptoms. Men are also less likely to attempt suicide, but more likely to die by suicide.

Women are more likely to be diagnosed with depression than men, even when they have the same symptoms, and they are more likely to be prescribed psychotropic medications.

For more information on the role that gender plays in mental illness, look in the Resource area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How does mental illness affect people of different ethnicities?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Cultural differences affect many aspects of mental illness, including rates of prevalence, symptom presentation, attitudes about and access to care, and even reactions to medication.

Many minority ethnicities experience greater environmental stressors in the form of violence, financial difficulty, homelessness and incarceration. These stressors increase the incidence of depression, anxiety and substance abuse. Immigrants from other cultures face the additional stresses of language barriers and adapting to a new culture.

Symptomology of many ethnic groups include more somatic or physical complaints, and some cultures do not differentiate between physical and mental illnesses.

Ethnic minorities are sometimes misdiagnosed because of these differences and also because of the cultural bias on the part of mental health providers.

Cultural bias and distrust of mainstream mental health providers as well as limited, access restrict the levels of care that many ethnic minorities get. Also, some ethnic minorities react differently to psychotropic medications, which sometimes results in over-medicating.

For more information on mental health and different ethnic communities, look in the Resource area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How does mental illness affect individuals in the LGBTQ community?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Because of the stigma attached to homosexuality, individuals in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning or LGBTQ community, face additional stressors that can increase their risk of mental illness. In fact, LGBTQ people experience anxiety, substance use and mood disorders at more than twice the rate of the general population.

LGBTQ adults are more often the victims of physical or verbal violence due to their sexual orientation and LGBTQ children and adolescents experience more bullying.

Because of the added stigma that our society places on homosexuality, LGBTQ individuals with mental illness are less likely to have the support of their family to help them in their recovery.

For more information on mental health issues in the LGBTQ population, look in the Resource area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are mania and hypomania?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Mania is a state of extreme energy and can be felt as irritability or agitation or as euphoria and intense well-being.  People who are experiencing a manic episode often have a reduced need for sleep, are very talkative and may talk faster than usual.  Feelings of invincibility can lead to greater risk taking behaviors and excessive spending.

Hypomania is a less severe form of mania.  People experiencing hypomania may feel extremely confident, productive and energized, but they are able to carry on day-to-day activities normally.

Hypomania crosses into full mania when there is loss of the ability to perform daily functions or an individual experiences psychosis.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I find myself or my loved one a place to live?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Depending on the individual's needs and income, there are many types of housing facilities and programs.

Private housing options include housing complexes that are affordable for individuals with low incomes, and the Section 8 Rental Assistance Programs which assist low-income households with rent subsidies so that their housing costs are lowered.

Independent living facilities are shared living environments that provide structure and fellowship for individuals who can manage their own medications and daily living tasks, and do not require supervision.

Single Room Occupancies, or SRO hotels, are typically single room units with a bed, small refrigerator and a microwave. These units can be affordable because they offer lower rents and usually do not require security deposits or first and last month's rent.

Residential care facilities, sometimes called Board and Care, are licensed facilities that are appropriate for individuals who need assistance with medication management or other supervision.  These facilities provide 24/7 care and supervision to residents.

There are also a number of emergency living arrangements provided through shelters and motel voucher programs.

For more information on housing options, click on the related questions or look in the Resource Area for a directory of housing resources.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is crisis housing?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Crisis housing facilities include emergency shelters, transitional shelters, motel vouchers, and winter shelters.

Emergency shelters offer a temporary overnight sleeping accommodation. The maximum stay varies depending on the program. Case management is sometimes available to clients.

Motel voucher programs shelter eligible families, disabled and elderly persons in participating motels throughout the County. Eligibility requirements vary from year-to-year; typically, the voucher programs require that clients present evidence that they are not able to stay in a traditional homeless shelter; and, they will be able to obtain permanent housing within approximately 3 to 4 weeks.

Winter Shelters provide short-term emergency winter shelter in order to accommodate the higher demand for shelter during the colder months. The winter shelter programs generally include temporary emergency shelter for veterans, single individuals, and families with children. The winter shelter programs usually operate from mid-December through mid-March.

Transitional Shelters offer housing, case management, and support services to return people to independent living, as soon as possible, often within 6 months, and usually not longer than 24 months.</Content>

<Content id="0">The Section 8 Rental Assistance Programs assist low-income households with rent subsidies so that their housing costs are lowered. The two Section 8 rental assistance programs are:  Housing Choice Voucher Program and Moderate Rehabilitation Program.

Participants of the Housing Choice Voucher  or HCV, Program are responsible for finding a rental unit that meets program guidelines. All assisted units are inspected to ensure that they are in decent, safe, and sanitary condition at the time of move in, and are re-inspected yearly. Under the HCV Program, a monthly rental assistance payment is issued directly to the landlord. The amount of assistance is determined by housing costs and participant income.

The Moderate Rehabilitation program provides assistance for specific housing units only. The County notifies individuals on the Moderate Rehabilitation waiting list of vacancies in the Moderate Rehabilitation units.  Individuals living in Moderate Rehabilitation units remain on the Section 8 waiting list so they can receive Section 8 rental assistance in the future. When individuals place their names on the Section 8 waiting list, they can request to be placed on the Moderate Rehabilitation list as well.

For more information on these programs, including eligibility requirements, look in the Resource Area.</Content>

These illnesses can range from mild to severe.   1 in 20 people live with serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the factors behind a mental illness diagnosis?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Mental illnesses can be the result of several different factors and scientists believe that in most cases, a mental illness has more than one cause.  For instance, we know that mental illness may have a genetic connection, meaning that if someone is diagnosed with a mental illness, others in their family are more likely to experience mental illness.  We also know that traumatic events, such as natural disasters, violence, bullying or extreme stress can play a role in triggering the onset of mental illness.  Certain viruses can contribute to mental illness, especially when they affect fetuses and young children.  Substance abuse, toxins in the environment, and brain injury are also known to cause mental illness.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Common misperceptions about mental illness</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Among the greatest problems facing those who experience mental illness are the untrue beliefs that many people have about these brain disorders.   These untrue beliefs keep people from getting the help and support they need.  So, let's set the record straight.

The truth is:  mental illness is no one's fault.  Lack of information about the science of the brain led to mental illness being viewed as a problem of will power,  character, or even faith.

The truth is:  In most cases, people with mental illness who take their medication regularly and who do not abuse alcohol or other drugs are no more violent than people who do not have a mental illness.   The risk of violence increases when mental illness is left untreated.  And, as is true of everyone, with or without a mental illness, the risk of violence increases when someone is using illegal or street drugs such as crack, meth, cocaine, speed, and PCP.

The truth is: There is hope for people with serious mental illness.  People who get treatment for mental illness can lead full and productive lives.  Although it is sometimes difficult to find appropriate treatments and support, they do exist and ongoing research holds promise for new, more effective treatments with fewer side effects.

Family and other caregivers can prepare by having crisis numbers at their fingertips and educating themselves about crisis response to mental health situations. Programs such as NAMI Family-to-family and Mental Health First Aid can help you prepare for dealing with crisis situations. We have included contact information and tips for handling crisis situations in the Resource Area of this page.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Do people recover from mental illness?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">When we speak of recovery, we mean the ability to live a full and satisfying life with mental illness.  Recovery is a life long journey which is defined differently by each person.  Recovery means creating a life where mental illness is not the main focus, a life comprised of healthy relationships and interests, and the ability to become a part of society and to contribute to society through working, volunteering, or taking part in social activities.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What treatments are there for mental illness?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Numerous treatments and services for mental illness are available and the majority of people diagnosed with mental illness that receive treatment experience relief from their symptoms.

Effective treatment for mental illness should address all aspects of the illness, including the biological, psychological and social aspects.  This bio-psycho-social model of treatment provides comprehensive treatment including medication, psychotherapy, and social supports.

Biological treatments address the level of chemicals in the brain that regulate emotions and behavior and include medications and non-pharmaceutical treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy or ECT.  They can also include exercise, nutritional support and other holistic treatments.

Psychological treatments address factors that influence emotional and behavioral functioning including feelings and thought processes, goal setting, and self-awareness. These can include Interpersonal Therapy, or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

Social supports and treatments address environmental factors such as family and relationships, employment, housing and education, and peer support.

The choice and combination of treatment and services depends on the type of mental illness, the severity of symptoms, the availability of options and individual preference.   Most people with mental illness report that a combination of treatments, services and supports works best to support their recovery.

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why isn't my loved one getting better?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">After a mental health crisis, it is normal for there to be a recuperation period.   Mental illness crises have real and lasting effects on physical and emotional well-being.  Because of this, it is important that during this period of recuperation, people who have had a mental illness crisis need to rest and avoid stress.  It is sometimes difficult for family and friends to understand these needs because their loved one looks fine, but in truth, they are physically and mentally exhausted.  The best thing that caregivers can do during this period is to learn about the mental illness affecting their loved one, to support them in finding and getting treatment, and to listen to them as they find their way back to a new normal.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the relationship between physical and mental health?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The human body is a single organism comprised of many parts working together as one, with each part affecting and being affected by others. This means that while mental illnesses may involve chemical imbalances in the brain, the rest of the body can be affected as well. Mood and brain function are impacted by what we eat and drink, how much or how little exercise we get, the music we listen to and even the color of our walls! Sleep and mental health are closely related as well. Explore the links to the left to learn more about how mental and physical health are interrelated.</Content>

<Content id="0">Recovery from mental illness is an ongoing process, a way of life even, not an event like recovery from the chicken pox or a broken arm.  It takes vigilance, planning and a strong support system.  Many people use a Wellness Recovery Action Plan to help them stay in recovery.  Others refer to their Recovery Toolbox, an informal list of things that help keep them on track and instructions on how to find their way again should they encounter difficulties.  Listen to the experiences of these individuals in recovery and look in the Resource Area for information on Recovery tools and WRAP plans.</Content>

<Content id="0">An important part of recovery is building a social network and healthy relationships with family and others. However, people with mental illness and their families are often isolated due to the nature of some mental illnesses and also due to stigma.

Support groups for consumers and family members can be a source of support from people who are experiencing the same things.

Drop in centers organize social events and provide a place where consumers can go to interact with others.</Content>

There are resources available to those who have a serious mental illness who have been unable to find adequate employment.

Government Social Security programs like SSI and SSDI, and food stamps are available to those who qualify. To learn about the financial support available in your state and community and how to apply for it, contact your local Social Security Administration  field office. There are links to agencies and sites in the Resource Area.

<Content id="0">In addition to your treatment plan, recovery may include activities that help you feel successful and productive. These activities may include hobbies, volunteer work or vocational training. Finding work in a setting that meets your personal needs can be an important part of helping you feel like a part of your community. Sometimes people need to learn new skills or relearn lost or forgotten skills. Practicing these skills in a supportive and safe place such as a drop-in center, advocacy center or Clubhouse program may be a good stepping-stone in recovery. In these places, you can work on social skills, practice working with others, follow a schedule and learn to work within your own limits and energy level. The best part of these activities is that you'll be working with others who understand what you are going through. For some people, a side effect of their illness is that they lose certain skills or cannot think as clearly or quickly as before. This  can lead to feelings of frustration or loss for those who can't easily return to their former work life. If this is the case for you, it's important to recognize those feelings. It won't happen overnight, but there are things you can do to help you prepare to return to work. Programs exist to help you find your strengths and help you successfully search for a job</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I help support my loved one with mental illness?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Individuals with mental illness describe three ways that family and other caregivers can best help them.

First, learn about the illness. Understanding the lived experience of our love ones with mental illness helps us to put their behaviors and struggles in perspective.

Second, help them get effective treatment and social supports.  Often individuals with mental illness do not have the energy or focus that is sometimes needed to navigate insurance companies, medical systems and social services We can help them by advocating for them and tracking down available resources. This can be especially challenging when we don't agree with our loved ones on what treatment is appropriate.  At times, our loved ones may not be able to act in their own best interest and there may even be times when your loved one's life depends on getting them treatment against their will.

And third, listen to their concerns and feelings with an open mind. Withhold judgment and advice, unless it is asked for, and give them the time and space to recuperate, and rebuild their life.</Content>

<Content id="0">The stigma around mental illness can isolate individuals and their families, eroding the social support systems that we come to depend upon to help us through other crises.

The Family-to-Family educational program and family support groups are great ways to build a supportive network of people who are experiencing the same struggles.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is mental illness or severe emotional disturbance in children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">In children, severe emotional disturbance is a term that describes disorders in children and adolescents that have difficulty functioning at home or in school or community settings.  These disorders are thought to be related to underlying conditions such as mental illnesses or environmental traumas such as physical or emotional abuse or neglect, out-of-home placement, brain injury, exposure to drugs and alcohol or to violence.

13% of youth aged 8-15 live with emotional disturbance severe enough to cause significant impairment in their day-to-day lives. This figure jumps to 21% in youth aged 13-18.

50% of all lifetime cases of severe emotional disturbance begin by age 14 and 75% by age 24.

Early detection and treatment of severe emotional disturbance is important.  Research into childhood emotional disturbances has shown that intensive early treatment may in some cases lessen the effects of the disorders and, in some cases, prevent serious mental illnesses from developing altogether.  Unfortunately, The average delay between onset of symptoms and intervention is 8-10 years. Only 50% of youth with diagnosable disorders receive treatment.

As a results, approximately 50% of students aged 14 and older with a severe emotional disturbance drop out of high school--the highest dropout rate of any disability group.

70% of youth in state and local juvenile justice systems have a diagnosable emotional or mental health impairment, with at least 20% experiencing severe symptoms.

Severe emotional disturbances that affect children and adolescents include but are not limited to anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorders, childhood-onset bipolar disorder, early onset depression, early onset schizophrenia, eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder or A.D.H.D.

<BaseQuestion id="0">Who should I talk to if I think my child or adolescent may have a mental illness?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">If you think your child may have an emotional or mental impairment talk to your child's primary care doctor about your concerns, and describe what you have seen.  If they confirm your feelings that there is a concern, then you can work toward getting your child the help they need.

As part of the diagnostic process a comprehensive physical examination should be done to rule out other physical conditions that may be causing a child's symptoms.  They should also be evaluated for substance use problems, learning disabilities, sensory integration problems, and other physical or mental disorders, that may cause behavioral problems or poor school performance.    You can also ask your child's school to do diagnostic testing to help with a diagnosis.

Once other causes for concerning behavior have been ruled out a mental health provider that specializes in childhood mental illness should be consulted. Your child's primary care physician may be able to refer you to a mental health professional.    To find a child psychiatrist, visit the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry website.  The link is listed in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What can I do to support my child?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">You can support your child or adolescent by helping them find an accurate diagnosis and effective treatments.
Getting an accurate diagnosis takes time and can be a frustrating process for the individual and family.  During this process it is important to focus on finding effective interventions to address the individual's symptoms.

If emotional or mental illness interferes with a child's education, schools are required to provide special education and related services in the school setting.  Families and teachers should work together to find effective interventions, accommodations, and supports that promote positive behaviors, academic achievement, and prevent challenging behaviors in school.

For some children, having a diagnosis is scary and they may be resistant to accept it.  Others are relieved to know that what is happening to them is caused by an illness, that they are not alone, and that there are treatment options that can make them feel and do better.

 It is important to find ways to use the strengths and interests of your child to help him or her cope with difficult symptoms. Activities like exercise, martial arts, music, and art can be extremely beneficial.   Ask your child's mental health professional to recommend effective interventions, skills training, support groups, and other options that can help your child cope with symptoms and develop the skills necessary to ultimately lead a full and productive life.

You can also support your child by educating yourself about mental illness.

<BaseQuestion id="0">Is medication use safe for children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There has been much concern about the use of psychotropic medications or medications to treat mental illness.  Little research has been done about the long term effects of these medications.

Psychotropic medications for young children should be used only when anticipated benefits outweigh risks. Parents should be fully informed and decisions made only after carefully weighing these factors. Children and adolescents must be closely monitored and frequently evaluated as the side effects common to some medications can be particularly difficult for children. At the same time, psychotropic medications can be lifesaving.

Medications are only part of a treatment plan which affects the biological causes of mental illness.  Even with medication mental illness can continue to affect an individual's life so it is important to address the psychological and social aspects of mental illness as well.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the relationship between physical and mental illnesses in older adults?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Many of the physical illnesses common in older adults co-occur with mental illnesses like anxiety and depression.  Some of the symptoms of these common illnesses can also mimic those of mental illness or dementia.  Likewise, the side effects of medications commonly taken by older adults can have side effects that mimic those of mental illness, especially in the case of drug interactions or overdose.

Heart or lung disease can affect behavior when there is not enough oxygen getting to the brain.  Diseases of the glands, such as the thyroid, adrenal, pituitary or pancreas can cause problems regulating emotion, perception, memory and thinking.

Poor nutrition can also contribute to symptoms of mental illness in older adults.  If the body is not getting adequate nutrition, it can affect behaviors.  Too little sugar in the bloodstream can cause confusion and personality changes, while conditions like pernicious anemia, caused by problems absorbing vitamin B12, can cause irritability, depression and dementia.

Physical issues related to aging, such as dental problems can contribute to poor nutrition, and lack of exercise due to limited mobility can cause depressed mood and irritability.</Content>

While the many life changes that come with aging can cause anyone to feel down or out of sorts, some people are not able to recover from these feelings like they might have at other times in their lives.</Content>

<Content id="0">Treatment for mental illness in older adults is consistent with treatment for other age groups.  Medications can be effective and it is important to tell all healthcare providers about all medications and supplements to avoid drug interactions.  Side effects should be closely monitored as well.

Psychotherapy is effective as well, and a combination of medication and therapy has been shown to be very effective in reducing the recurrence of depression in older adults.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I support older adults?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are many things loved ones can do to support older adults who either have a risk of developing or are currently living with mental illness.

Loss of a loved one, loss of independence, isolation, lasting complications or pain stemming from medical conditions, economic lifestyle changes, the stress of caring for a disabled spouse, the lack of the robustness of youth, or a combination of these and other factors increase the risk of mental illness and suicide in older adults.

Inform your loved one's caregivers of any changes in behavior or mood that you see and make sure physical causes for these changes are ruled out by medical professionals.

Pay close attention to mood and provide extra support during transitions, such as changes in housing arrangements, new illness diagnoses or treatment, or changes in mobility and independence. Also, make sure that healthcare professionals are asking about suicidal ideation and monitoring mental health during these periods as well.

Take steps to ensure the senior in your life is not left bereft and feeling alone. Visit often. Interact by playing games, dining together, or simply talking. Frequent visits help determine if seniors are doing well. Interacting provides the opportunity to look for and gauge the signs listed above in an unobtrusive way. If you can't visit yourself, look into volunteer or paid services where your loved one lives to find a companion who can visit them. Some facilities have programs to keep older adults active and engaged, and there are community programs that they can take part in as well if they are living on their own.

Also you can help your older loved one stay safe from phone and internet scams by educating them on how to protect their privacy.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is stigma?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Stigma is viewing someone in a negative way because they have an illness or condition.  For people with mental illness and their families stigma is everywhere--it can even come from ourselves.

Stigma is when our loved ones with mental illness are excluded from social activities, job opportunities, and education.  It is in the media where people with mental illness are portrayed as violent criminals.  It is in the social services system that is ill-equipped to meet the needs of people with mental illness.

And stigma is when people with mental illness don't want to get treatment or take medication because they believe these negative views themselves.  Or, when family members blame themselves for a loved one's mental illness.

There is much you can do to help fight stigma.  For more information look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is recovery language?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Language is important.  How we speak about mental illness can dispel stigma and stereotypes or reinforce them.  Recovery language is person focused, putting the emphasis on the person and their strengths rather than their illness.  For instance, we use the phrase "individuals with mental illness" rather than mentally ill individuals.  We talk about a person having schizophrenia rather than a "schizophrenic person."   When talking about symptoms we talk about what the person is experiencing, so rather than saying that someone is delusional, we say they are having delusions.  For a guide to using recovery focused language, look in the Resource Area.</Content>
