<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a clinical study?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical research studies are often conducted by means of a clinical study. The United States National Institutes of Health defines a clinical study as “one type of clinical research that follows a pre-defined plan or protocol.” A clinical study is a scientifically controlled study of the safety and effectiveness of investigational drugs and devices for various diseases and conditions. These studies determine if these investigational drugs or devices are safe to use and will improve the health of people. Before a medication, therapy, or medical device can be made available to the general public, it has to go through several phases of clinical research.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the phases of a clinical trial?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical studies are typically performed in “phases.” These phases are designed to build evidence that an investigational drug or device will be beneficial to patients with a particular disease or condition. Before a medication can be tested in human subjects, pre-clinical testing occurs in a lab environment that may involve animals. The goal is to gather data on whether the investigational drug or device has the potential to work in treating the disease.Before a medication moves to testing in humans, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, reviews pre-clinical testing results to determine if the investigational compound can further be studied in humans. If the investigational compound can be studied in humans, that research is divided into different phases. In Phase I, researchers test an investigational medication in a small group of people to evaluate its safety and identify side effects. Often, healthy volunteers are used as participants.In Phase II, the investigational medication is given to a larger group of people to see if it is effective, determine optimal dosage, and to further evaluate safety.In Phase III, the investigational medication is given to a large group of people to confirm effectiveness, monitor side effects, and compare it to existing treatments.In Phase IV studies, the medication is further studied after it has been approved for sale by relevant regulatory authorities. Further information is gathered on the medication’s effect on different populations and its long-term side effects.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the types of clinical trials?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are two main types of clinical studies: Placebo-controlled and head-to-head studies. A placebo-controlled study means that one group of patients will receive the investigational drug to be evaluated, while a second group, often known as the control group, will receive a placebo. The placebo often looks just like the experimental drug but is designed to have no effect on patients.Placebos are often used in blinded studies, which are studies where the patients do not know whether the are receiving the experimental drug or placebo. Blinding is used to help eliminate the "placebo effect," which is bias introduced into the study. Bias may result from a patient's belief that he or she is receiving a certain treatment or the researcher's belief that a certain result will occur.In a head-to-head or comparative effectiveness study, one group of patients receives the investigational drug to be evaluated, while a second group of patients receives a different therapy. This allows researchers to see how the experimental treatment performs in comparison to other therapies. In a head-to-head study there is no placebo, and the patient has a chance of receiving either the investigational drug or another treatment. In most cases, the other treatment, also called a comparator or reference treatment is already commonly prescribed by doctors for patients with the disease that is being investigated in the study. The reference treatment is often referred to as the "standard of care."</Content>

<Content id="0">A Data Safety and Monitoring Committee, sometimes known as a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, is an independent group of experts who monitor patient safety and treatment effectiveness data during the course of a clinical study.This group typically includes 3 to 10 members and is authorized to recommend that a study be stopped due to safety concerns. This may occur after the group reviews a subset of the data from the study that shows the study treatment is not effective or if the investigational treatment is so beneficial that it should urgently be considered for approval by the regulatory authorities.Members of the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee are independent from anyone involved in the study.The committee is usually made up of expert clinicians with knowledge of the disease or condition being treated, statisticians, and sometimes a patient advocacy representative.</Content>

<Content id="0">Laws and ethical guidelines governing clinical research in many countries around the world require that potential study participants be given certain information about the planned study through a process known as "informed consent." This process is designed to accurately inform individuals of the purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to the clinical study. The informed consent process also ensures that participants understand information about the study and how it relates to their own health or interests. It also provides an opportunity for an individual to make a voluntary decision about whether to participate in the study.Once you have had enough time to read and understand the informed consent form and had time to discuss it with the study doctor, you can determine if you wish to participate in the study. If you choose to participate, you will sign the informed consent form. Even if you sign the form, you can still withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason.</Content>

<Content id="0">If you decline to participate in a clinical study, you can change your mind later as long as the study is still accepting new patients. During the informed consent process, it is recommended that you discuss any concerns that you may have about the study with the clinical research team. You should also ask how long they plan to enroll study participants and if there will be an additional enrollment period at a later date. At no point should you feel pressured by the clinical research team to join the study. It should also be noted that if you enroll in the study and decide that you no longer wish to participate, you can withdraw at any time without penalty.</Content>

<Content id="0">It is difficult to say whether there will be other opportunities to participate in future clinical studies. Although new investigational drugs and devices are constantly moving through the clinical research process, there is no guarantee that you will be a good candidate for these studies. Clinical trials for many conditions are listed on ClinicalTrials.gov, a website sponsored by the U.S. National Institutes of Health.</Content>

<Content id="0">When discussing clinical studies, you might notice that they can also be referred to as "single-blind" or "double-blind."A single-blind study means that the investigators involved in the studies know whether the patient is getting the investigational drug, but the patient is not aware of what study treatment he or she is getting.In a double-blind study, neither the investigator nor the patient knows who is receiving the investigational drug."Blinding" the studies helps reduce the possibility that any intentional or unintentional biases are introduced into the study.</Content>
