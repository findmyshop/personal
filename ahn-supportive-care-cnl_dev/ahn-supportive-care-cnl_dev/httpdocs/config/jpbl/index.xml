<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a clinical trial?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A clinical trial is a medical research study performed to test investigational treatments and devices for a disease or condition. These studies determine if treatments and devices are safe to use and if they improve the health of people. Before a treatment or device can be made available to the general public, it has to go through several phases of clinical research. Most prescription medications are available as a result of previous clinical trials.</Content>

<Content id="0">Clinical trials are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The primary role of the FDA regarding clinical trials is to promote the safety of trial participants, in part by ensuring adherence to a set of principles known as good clinical practices. These practices enhance the quality of clinical trial data and ensure the protection of trial participants like you. There are also other regulatory agencies, such as the European Medical Agency, outside of the United States involved in overseeing clinical trials.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the phases of a clinical trial?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical trials are typically performed in steps or "phases." These phases are designed to establish that an investigational treatment will be safe and also beneficial to patients with a particular disease or condition.Before a treatment can be tested in human subjects, pre-clinical testing occurs in a lab environment to gather preliminary data on whether the investigational treatment has the potential to work. Next, the investigational treatment transitions to a Phase I clinical trial, which typically involves a relatively small number of volunteers or patients and is designed to evaluate whether the investigational treatment is safe and to determine what dose should be given to people. If the results show that the treatment is safe, it transitions into Phase II clinical trials, where it will be tested in patients with the disease or condition to see whether the treatment has any effect on the disease. If the treatment performs well, it transitions into Phase III trials, which involve a relatively large number of patients to assess the effectiveness of the investigational treatment and how it compares to existing standard therapies.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the types of clinical trials?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are two main types of clinical trials: Blinded and unblinded, or open-label, trials.In unblinded trials, both the study staff and the patients are aware of the drug or treatment the patient is receiving. In single-blind trials, the study staff knows whether a patient is getting the investigational medicine but the patient is not aware. In a double-blind trial, neither the study staff nor the patient knows who is receiving the investigational medicine. By "blinding" the trial, no biases--whether real or unintentional--are introduced.Placebos are often used in blinded trials, so you may also hear blinded trials referred to as placebocontrolled--or comparative--trials. This means that one group of patients will receive the investigational medicine to be evaluated, while a second group, often known as the control group, will receive a placebo. This placebo looks just like investigational medicine but contains no active ingredients. In cancer trials, the investigational medicine or placebo is typically given 
<i>in addition to</i>the standard treatment. This means that a patient enrolled in any cancer trial will always receive active treatment, even if they are receiving the placebo and not the investigational medicine.Placebos are used to ensure that any observed effect can be properly attributed to the investigational medicine.</Content>

<Content id="0">A Data Monitoring Committee is an independent group of experts who monitors patient safety and treatment efficacy during the course of a clinical trial. The committee keeps all of the data and information it reviews confidential so as not to affect the integrity of the study. The committee, which typically includes 3 to 10 members, is authorized to recommend that a trial be stopped due to safety concerns, because the treatment is not effective, or if the investigational medicine is so beneficial that it should be immediately considered for approval. Members of the Data Monitoring Committee are not related to the institution or company conducting or sponsoring the trial and are usually made up of clinicians with knowledge of the disease or condition being treated, statisticians, and sometimes a patient advocacy representative.</Content>

<Content id="0">Eli Lilly and Company, the sponsor of this study, considers safety and well-being of individual research participants to be very important. In order to conduct a clinical trial, the research team must comply with laws and regulations of the country or countries in which a study is conducted. These laws and regulations were designed to protect your physical and psychological well-being, as well as to preserve the integrity of the research. In addition to compliance with the law, the conduct of Eli Lilly and Company-sponsored trials is also consistent with both the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America's Principles on Conduct of Clinical Trials and well-respected global ethical guidelines. One of the main points of the ethical guidelines is that individuals should be treated with respect from the time they are approached for possible participation in the trial, throughout their participation, and after their participation ends. These guidelines are developed and monitored by global medical and health organizations and ensure individuals' right to privacy and their right to change their minds about being in the trial at any point.</Content>

<Content id="0">The nature of participating in a clinical study means that you may receive an investigational medicine, which could be perceived by some as making you a "guinea pig." However, as a participant in any clinical trial, you have rights. One key aspect of protecting research participants' rights is the informed consent process, which is designed to respect an individual's autonomy and protect an individual's freedom of choice. Each individual who wishes to participate in Eli Lilly and Company-sponsored research is informed both verbally and in writing of the purpose, methods, and possible risks and benefits of a study, as well as the fact that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason.The individual's consent to participate in a study is documented by a signature of agreement. In the case of an individual who is not capable of giving informed consent, including children, the consent of a legally authorized representative may be obtained on behalf of that individual, provided that the study participant is willing to participate.In addition to the informed consent process, all procedures and tests performed prior to participation, during participation, and after participation ends are clearly outlined in the clinical study protocol, which is reviewed and agreed to by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, your physician-investigator, and an institutional review board. The protocols are subject both to laws and regulations and to ethical guidelines, which require that the study is designed in a way so as to answer a specific scientific question. Therefore, unnecessary experiments or those that are not aimed at answering the pre-determined scientific question cannot be performed.</Content>

<Content id="0">Placebos are considered ethical when used within appropriate boundaries that protect the safety and well-being of research participants. In most cases, participants in cancer trials will receive an active standard of care treatment commonly given to patients with that type of cancer. Some patients will be randomized to receive a combination of standard of care and placebo, while others will receive a combination of standard of care and the investigational medicine. Cancer clinical trials are often done to determine whether there is an additional benefit to the patient when the investigational medicine is combined with the standard of care treatment. In order to do this, it is necessary to compare this type of combination treatment to a combination of placebo and standard of care.Patients participating in a placebo-controlled clinical trial are told during the informed consent process that there is a chance that they could receive the investigational medicine or an inactive placebo plus standard of care while participating in the trial.</Content>

<Content id="0">Under the terms of the informed consent process, you will be informed about the risks and benefits of participating in a clinical trial. The purpose of a clinical trial is to assess both the safety and effectiveness of an investigational medicine. Because the investigational medicine is still considered "experimental," there is no guarantee that it will be effective. Therefore, one of the risks associated with participation is that you may not receive therapeutic benefit from the investigational medicine. However, if you decide the research does not meet your needs, you can choose not to participate. Likewise if you change your mind during the course of the trial, you can withdraw from the clinical trial at any time without penalty.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is being tested in this trial? What is the purpose of this trial?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The purpose of this trial is to learn if the addition of the investigational medicine to standard of care medication can delay progression of metastatic breast cancer for women who have locally advanced or metastatic hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancer, which is often abbreviated as HR+ HER2- breast cancer. The investigational medicine is designed to slow tumor growth. The combination of investigational medicine plus standard of care medication will be compared to the combination of placebo plus standard of care medication.You are being asked to take part in this trial because you have been diagnosed with breast cancer that has spread to nearby sites, called locally advanced, or to distant sites, which is called metastatic.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Will the study staff know what trial treatment I’m getting?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">This trial is designed to be double-blind, which means that neither you, as the participant, nor the study staff will know whether you are getting the investigational medicine or the placebo. This is done to ensure that the trial results are not influenced by what is known as the placebo effect, whereby an effect is caused by the patient's belief that they are receiving a certain treatment, or through researcher bias. If you have concerns about receiving either of the trial treatments, please contact the study staff.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Could my breast cancer progress?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">One of the main reasons this trial is being done is to learn more about how the investigational medicine controls the growth of breast cancer. There is a possibility that your breast cancer could worsen while you participate in the clinical trial. If this occurs, you and the study doctor might decide that you should stop taking part in the trial. However, the information about your experience will still be useful to other patients with breast cancer, and the study doctor will continue to follow your condition in order to better interpret the results of the trial.</Content>
