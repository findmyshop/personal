<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I calculate my due date?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">If you have a regular 28 day menstrual cycle, your due date is calculated by adding 280 days, or 40 weeks, to the first day of your last menstrual period.  Your menstrual period and ovulation are counted as the first two weeks of pregnancy.
Your due date is only an estimate. On average only 5% of births take place exactly on the estimated due date. Most babies are born within a week before or after the estimated due date and a normal pregnancy can last anywhere between 38 and 42 weeks.

Every pregnancy is unique and your baby will come when it's ready. Be sure to talk to your health care provider about your due date.  If you don't have a regular 28 day menstrual cycle your doctor can help determine your due date.  For a due date calculator, see the link in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Do ovulation predictor kits work?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">When taken correctly, ovulation tests are approximately 99% accurate in detecting the hormone surge that happens just before ovulation. However, these tests cannot confirm whether ovulation actually occurs a day or two later.

Ovulation tests uses a sample of your urine to detect the increase in a specific hormone, called luteinizing hormone, or LH, that typically happens about one day before ovulation.

Test your urine with the ovulation predictor kit each day beginning about ten days after the first day of your period. The day the kit reads "positive" is the best time to try to become pregnant.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">I am thinking about trying to conceive, what should I do?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">If you're trying to get pregnant there are many benefits to planning ahead.

Eat a healthy diet and take your vitamins, especially folic acid as it is essential for your baby's development and can help prevent some birth defects.  Limit caffeine intake, and eliminate alcohol to increase the likelihood of becoming pregnant.

Before you try to get pregnant. Talk to your doctor about any medications you are taking, including over the counter medicines as some of them can make it difficult to conceive or may negatively affect the baby after conception.  Some over-the-counter vaginal lubricants can decrease fertility, as can saliva. If you need a lubricant, consider mineral oil or canola oil  or ask your doctor for other suggestions

Try to maintain a healthy weight and get moderate exercise, but don't overdo it.  Five hours or more a week of vigorous exercise can impair fertility in women who are not overweight.  Managing your stress levels can also help you get pregnant.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the common early pregnancy symptoms?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Most likely the earliest symptom of pregnancy that you will experience will be a missed period when you are about 4 weeks pregnant.  At this time you may also begin to experience mild cramping and blood spotting, which could be mistaken for your period. In this case, you may not realize that you're pregnant.  However, in week four, a pregnancy test will be able to detect levels of hCG, the pregnancy hormone, in your urine. Other symptoms of pregnancy you might have during this week include fatigue, nausea, tingling or aching breasts, frequent urination, and feeling bloated.</Content>

<Content id="0">There are many factors that can make a pregnancy high risk, including pre-existing conditions and conditions that develop during pregnancy.  Talk to your doctor to find out how the following risk factors may affect your pregnancy and what you can do to reduce your risks.
&#8226;	Pregnancy risks are higher for mothers age 35 and older.
&#8226;	Smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol and using illegal drugs can put a pregnancy at risk.
&#8226;	A prior C-section, low birth weight baby or birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy might increase the risk of complications in future pregnancies.
&#8226;	A family history of genetic conditions or history of pregnancy loss or the death of a baby shortly after birth signals in increased risk of complications as well.
&#8226;	Chronic conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and epilepsy increase pregnancy risks as can anemia, infections or mental health conditions.
&#8226;	Pregnancies can become high risk due to complications that develop during pregnancy such as problems with parts of the reproductive system. Other concerns might include too much or too little amniotic fluid, if the baby is too small for how far along the pregnancy is, or if a mother with Rh negative blood is having a baby with Rh positive blood.
&#8226;	Also, pregnancy risks are higher for women carrying two or more babies.</Content>

<Content id="0">Having food cravings or a strong dislike for specific foods during pregnancy is very common.   Cravings usually start during the first trimester and peak during the second, but they can happen at any time.  One theory is that cravings are caused by your body's need for certain nutrients.  Strong dislike for certain foods is often the result of hormonal changes that affect the senses of smell and taste.  These food aversions can contribute to nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Is dizziness common in pregnancy?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Feeling dizzy or faint is very common during pregnancy. It is most common during the first trimester, but it can happen anytime during pregnancy. Most often dizziness or fainting does not mean something is wrong. It is often caused by a drop in blood pressure. Hormones released during pregnancy relax the body's blood vessels, lowering the amount of blood being pumped up to the brain. When this happens, you may feel faint. Fainting is not dangerous to you or your baby unless you fall or hurt yourself. To prevent dizziness, avoid standing for long periods of time. Get up slowly after lying or sitting down. If you start to feel dizzy while you're driving, pull over. If you're standing when dizziness hits, lie down on your left side. Seek prompt care if the dizziness is severe and occurs with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding. This could indicate that the fertilized egg has implanted outside the uterus. This is called an ectopic pregnancy. To prevent life-threatening complications, ectopic pregnancies cannot be continued and must be surgically removed.</Content>

<Content id="0">Fatigue, or tiredness, is common in the first trimester. During the first three months of pregnancy, levels of the hormone progesterone increase and this can make you feel very tired. You should watch your diet to make sure you are getting enough iron and protein, and include physical activity, such as a brisk walk, in your daily routine. But there is not really much you can do to prevent this tiredness, so get your rest while you can.</Content>

<Content id="0">Pregnancy can cause lower back pain. As you gain weight more pressure is put on the nerves and blood vessels in the spine. Also as your baby grows, your center of gravity changes causing changes in your posture. Your hormones are also relaxing the ligaments in your pelvis and the muscles in your abdomen. All of this puts strain on the muscles in the lower back, causing pain. Stress can also cause muscles to tighten and spasm which can cause back pain as well.</Content>

<Content id="0">Mood swings are very common in the first trimester of pregnancy and toward the end of the third trimester. Your feelings can range from excitement, to fear to sadness and can change quickly. These mood swings are caused by changing levels of the hormones progesterone and estrogen. When your hormones levels change a lot over a short period of time, it affects brain chemicals that regulate your mood. Other things can make your mood swings worse: the fatigue of pregnancy can make it more difficult to manage your mood as can morning sickness, heartburn, and the frequent need to urinate.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is morning sickness?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Morning sickness is nausea or vomiting that occurs during pregnancy.  It may be caused by hormone changes or lower blood sugar during early pregnancy. Emotional stress, fatigue, traveling, or some foods can make the problem worse.  Despite its name, morning sickness can happen at any time of the day.  Most pregnant women have at least some nausea, and about a third have vomiting.
Morning sickness usually begins during the first month of pregnancy and continues through the 14th to 16th week, the 3rd or 4th month, but some women have nausea and vomiting through their entire pregnancy.
Although morning sickness can leave you tired and drained, it is not harmful to the baby unless you lose weight from severe vomiting. A small amount of weight loss during the first trimester is not unusual when women have mild morning sickness, and is not harmful to the baby.   See your doctor if your morning sickness does not improve, or you lose more than 2 pounds or if you vomit more than 3 times per day or you cannot keep food or liquid down.

Also, call your doctor immediately if you vomit blood or material that looks like coffee grounds or if you vomit more than 3 times per day or cannot keep any food or liquid down.

Nausea and vomiting can continue beyond your 4th month of pregnancy. This is usually not harmful, but let your doctor know if you continue to experience morning sickness after your first trimester.</Content>

For instance, some seafood is high in mercury, including swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tilefish. Avoid these and limit albacore tuna and tuna steak to no more than 6 ounces a week. Also avoid raw, undercooked or contaminated seafood. Do not eat undercooked meat, poultry or eggs. Safe cooking instructions can be found in the Resources area. During pregnancy, you're at increased risk of bacterial food poisoning , so eat and drink only pasteurized dairy products, including milk and cheeses. Drink only pasteurized juices as well. Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly and avoid all raw sprouts. Sprouts can be eaten if cooked thoroughly. Avoid caffeine, alcohol and even herbal teas as these can contain herbs that are harmful to your baby.</Content>

Quitting can still help to protect you and your baby.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What do they look at during prenatal testing?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A number of screening tests are done during pregnancy to evaluate the health of mom and baby.  During the first trimester tests look for certain birth defects of baby's heart or chromosomal disorders, such as Down syndrome. These tests are done by drawing blood from the mom and doing an ultrasound.  In the second trimester serum blood tests measure the risk of other birth defects such as neural tube defects and chromosomal disorders.   Ultrasound is done to check that the baby is growing as expected and to look for physical birth defects or other problems with the baby.  If there is a known risk of chromosomal or other disorders or if blood tests or ultrasound indicate that there may be issues, other prenatal testing such as Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) or Amniocentesis may be done.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why are ultrasounds done?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Ultrasounds, also called sonograms, use sound to create pictures of your baby in the womb.  They are done to make sure your baby's development and growth are on track, that the baby's heart is working properly and that all the organs are developing normally.  Ultrasounds can also help determine a woman's due date and screen for any issues with the placenta and mom's uterus, fallopian tubes or ovaries.  If tests such as Chorionic Villus Sampling are done, an ultrasound may be used to help guide your healthcare provider as they perform the test.</Content>

<Content id="0">During the first trimester blood tests will be done to determine your  blood type and Rh factor, screen for anemia, check for immunity to rubella (German measles), and test for hepatitis B, syphilis, HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.
Depending on your risk factors and medical history, you may be offered tests and genetic counseling to assess risks for diseases such as Tay-Sachs, cystic fibrosis, and sickle cell anemia.  Tests for exposure to viruses such as toxoplasmosis and the chicken pox virus may also be done. Your health care provider may also check your levels of hCG, and progesterone, which are hormones that are important during pregnancy.
Urine tests look for kidney infection and detect glucose and albumin, the protein that indicates preeclampsia, which is pregnancy-induced high blood pressure.</Content>

<Content id="0">There is no need to be anxious if your baby doesn't seem to be moving a lot at this stage of the pregnancy. In fact, at this stage of pregnancy, many women find they didn't notice the baby's movement for up to four days at a time. The baby is actually moving constantly, but you won't always feel it depending on the position and the baby's position in the womb. However, you should let your healthcare provider know if a day goes by without your feeling any movement.</Content>

<Content id="0">Any baby born before 37 weeks is considered premature and is at risk for having health problems that can be life-long. The earlier in pregnancy that you give birth, the more likely your baby is to have severe health problems. Some premature babies have to spend time in a hospital's neonatal intensive care unit (also called NICU). But thanks to advances in medical care, even babies born very prematurely are more likely to survive today than ever before.</Content>

The fatigue and nausea of early pregnancy usually ease but not for all women. You may experience more dizziness due to the uterus pressing on nerves or due to low blood sugar.

They are caused by hormonal changes that affect skin fibers, not by the weight gain itself, and there really is no way to prevent them. However, these marks fade over time, and you can help reduce the appearance of stretch marks using over-the-counter creams.</Content>

You can also try kneeling on hands and knees to take the pressure off your spine.  Lying on your side rather than your back may help as well.  Mild heat from a heating pad can also help.</Content>

<Content id="0">There may be times when the baby does not move as much. In the third trimester there are space constraints that make movement more difficult, and your baby has developed a regular sleep and wake cycle. Sometimes a decrease in movement just means that your baby is sleeping soundly. You should be able to wake the baby up by eating a snack. However, you should pay attention to your baby's activity. Count fetal movements a few times a day and report any sudden decreases to your practitioner. If you don't feel 10 movements within two hours, contact your healthcare provider right away.</Content>

However, about 4% of the time, the baby is in a breech position, with the buttocks closest to the cervix and the head up. When you get close to your due date, if the baby has not dropped into the head down position, your healthcare provider may try to turn the baby by pressing down on the uterus from outside the womb. If you are in labor and the baby has still not turned, your healthcare provider may recommend that you have a cesarean section.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What should I expect in labor and birth?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Labor happens in three stages. The first stage, early labor, is when the cervix starts to expand. Mild contractions may begin, and your water may break. Early labor usually lasts for 6-12 hours, and you may be able to be up and walking around, taking a shower, and preparing to go to the hospital. When your contractions are 3-4 minutes apart, you are in active labor. This is the time to go to the hospital. During active labor your cervix continues to dilate, and if your water has not already broken, it may happen during this phase as your contractions become stronger and more regular. Depending on whether you have opted for childbirth with or without pain medication, you may experience pain and pressure, especially in your back. You may have leg cramps and nausea as well. This phase of labor lasts 8 hours on average for first time mothers, but your labor may be longer or shorter. When the cervix is fully dilated at 10 centimeters and the baby begins to enter the birth canal, you'll be instructed to begin pushing. You may feel the urge to push, which can be like having a strong urge to have a bowel movement. The skin and muscles around the opening of the vagina will stretch, and you may need an episiotomy, or a small incision, to prevent the skin between the vagina and rectum from tearing. As the baby's head emerges some of the pain and pressure will be relieved. The nurse or doctor will clean out the baby's nose and mouth, then rotate the head a bit to ease passage of the baby's shoulders. Then with a final push or two, your baby is delivered.</Content>

<Content id="0">True labor begins when you are having regular contractions 5 minutes apart for an hour, but even days before contractions start in earnest there can be early signs that your baby is on its way. One early sign of labor is lightening, when the baby's head drops down into position for delivery. This can occur anytime from a few weeks to a few hours before labor. You may also see what is called bloody show, which is the plug of mucus that has covered the opening to the uterus during pregnancy. This will be a brownish or slightly bloody discharge and can occur days before labor. Diarrhea or changes in your bowel habits, is common in the days leading up to labor as well. Your water may break early in labor or not until birth, and most women usually go into labor within 24 hours of their water breaking. You may experience "false labor" or Braxton-Hicks contractions starting in your second trimester, but these mild contractions are irregular and are not a sign that you are going into labor.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What happens when my water breaks? How will I know?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The sac of fluid that surrounds and protects your baby during pregnancy may break early in labor or just before birth. When it breaks, sometimes there is a gush of fluid, and sometimes it is only a trickle. After the first gush of amniotic fluid, it may continue to trickle out for some time. It might be difficult to tell the difference between amniotic fluid and urine, especially if it is only a trickle. If you are uncertain whether your water has broken, please contact your healthcare provider. Most women deliver within 8 hours of their water breaking, but there is usually no need to rush to the hospital unless your contractions start coming 4 to 6 minutes apart. However, you should let your healthcare provider know if you think your water has broken. Amniotic fluid should be clear and odorless. If it is yellow, green, or brown, please contact your healthcare provider right away.</Content>

<Content id="0">If you're not breastfeeding it can take 7-10 days for your milk to dry up and ease the discomfort in your breasts.  In the meantime, wear a supportive bra but do not bind your breasts, and use cool compresses or ice packs to help with pain.  You may express a small amount of milk to reduce the fullness, but keep in mind that this may increase the amount of time it takes for your milk to dry up completely.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How do I care for my stitches after an episiotomy?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">To take care of your stitches and relieve pain in the perineal area, you need to keep the stitches clean. This means you need to care for them twice a day and after every bowel movement. To care for your stiches, you will need a clean sanitary pad, squirt bottle, liquid soap, dermaplast or other antibacterial pain relieving spray, and Tucks pads. Before beginning, wash your hands. Fill the squirt bottle with warm tap water. Remove your sanitary pad from front to back. Sit on the toilet and using the squirt bottle, squirt warm water from front to back between your legs so the water flows over your stitches. Blot dry from front to back using toilet tissue, then drop the tissue into the toilet. Use clean tissue if you need to dry again. Spray your stitches with the antibacterial spray. And, if desired, place a Tucks pad on the skin side of your clean sanitary pad so that it will be in contact with your stitches. Apply your clean pad, then wash your hands again. Your doctor may also want you to soak in a sitz bath to help your stitches heal. For more information on sitz baths, look in the related questions area of this page.</Content>

Hemorrhoids usually shrink and disappear on their own within the first few weeks after delivery.  To relieve the discomfort of hemorrhoids, you can use a sitz bath, then apply a doctor recommended cream.  A pain relieving suppository may also be used to reduce pain.  A good diet can help you avoid constipation and straining during bowel movements.  Drink lots of fluids and eat fruits, vegetables, whole grain and bran products.</Content>

<Content id="0">Due to damage to the bladder and urethra, you may occasionally leak urine when you cough, sneeze or laugh for the next few months after birth. Kegel exercises can help you regain control over these muscles and reduce this problem.   Kegel exercises strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor. These muscles are weakened by the birth process and should be exercised right after birth. However, it may be hard to do these exercises soon after your delivery. Do as many as you can, and the tone will slowly return.    For more information on kegel exercises, look in the Resources Area.</Content>

<Content id="0">Back labor describes labor pain that is felt mostly in the lower back. There are things you can do to ease back pain during labor. Back rubs and pressure applied to your hips during contractions may help. Some women find that changing positions, taking a walk, straddling a chair or leaning forward on pillows or a birthing ball can also help. You can also try kneeling on hands and knees to take the pressure off your spine. Lying on your side rather than your back as well as mild heat from a heating pad may help. Epidural or spinal anesthesia can also temporarily block back pain during labor. For more suggestions on birthing positions and help for back labor, look in the Resources area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a Cesarean or C-Section birth and why would I need it?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A Cesarean birth, or c-section, is when a baby is delivered through an opening that a surgeon cuts through your belly and uterus rather than through your vagina.   C-sections are usually only done for the safety of the mom and baby when there may be problems with the pregnancy or delivery.   Your healthcare provider may require you to have a c-section if you've had a previous c-section, if there are problems with the placenta, or if you have an infection like HIV or herpes.  C-sections are also sometimes recommended if you are having multiple births or you have a chronic health condition like diabetes or high blood pressure.   Even if there are no problems with your pregnancy, issues during birth may prompt your healthcare provider to perform a cesarean;  for instance, if the baby is too big to pass through your vagina or is in the wrong position for birth.  You may also need a cesarean if the umbilical cord becomes trapped in the vagina where it would be compressed during labor.  And, of course, if your baby is having problems during labor, like a slow heart rate, your healthcare provider may decide that the baby should be delivered via cesarean.   For more information on c-sections look in the Resources area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">When can I start my birth control?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Your healthcare provider may suggest that you not have sex for a period of time after you give birth, but when you do resume sexual activity, you should use some form of birth control if you do not want to conceive. Your period may not start for 6-8 weeks, but it's possible that you may ovulate before having a period. Breast feeding can protect against pregnancy for a while; however, by itself, breastfeeding is not a reliable form of birth control. Estrogen lowers milk production so birth control that contains estrogen, while not harmful to the baby, may not be ideal. Estrogen is used in many hormonal birth control products like most birth control pills, patches, and vaginal rings. There are also some birth control pills that contain only progestin and which prevent pregnancy without affecting milk supply. While you are breast feeding, you can also use barrier methods of birth control like condoms or a diaphragm.</Content>

<Content id="0">Your recovery time after delivery depends on the type of delivery you have, whether you have any complications and what type of work you do.  Typically women are told not to drive for two weeks after a vaginal delivery and six weeks after a c-section.  Ultimately, the decision on when to return to work is one you should discuss with your doctor, your family and your employer.</Content>

<Content id="0">Most breastfeeding moms do not need a special diet. You should eat a healthy, well balanced diet and drink plenty of fluids. You'll need an extra 450 to 500 calories a day. There are some things you should avoid while breastfeeding:

&#8226; 	Avoid foods that upset your baby's stomach. Common culprits are gassy foods like cabbage, and spicy foods.
&#8226; 	Limit drinks with added sugars, such as sodas and fruit drinks
&#8226; 	Drink caffeine in moderation, no more than 24 ounces a day
&#8226; Avoid large amounts of alcohol. An occasional alcoholic drink is okay, but wait 2 or more hours before breastfeeding again
&#8226; 	Avoid seafood that's high in mercury, including swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish
&#8226; And,eat canned tuna instead of tuna steaks. It has less mercury.</Content>

<Content id="0">Up to half of pregnant women have some bleeding during their pregnancy. It doesn't always mean there is something wrong, but it could possibly be a sign of a serious complication. If you have any bleeding or spotting you should call the doctor, even if the bleeding stops. Keep track of your bleeding and note if it gets heavier or lighter, how many pads you are using and the color of the blood. And, don't use a tampon or have sex while you are bleeding. Call your doctor or go to the emergency room immediately if you have heavy bleeding that requires you to change your sanitary pad once an hour or more, if you have bleeding with pain, cramping or dizziness, or if you have pain in your belly or pelvis.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the stages of cervical dilation?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">During pregnancy, your cervix is closed; it is plugged with mucus to keep out infection. It is long and firm and should point slightly toward your back. In the last weeks of pregnancy, before labor begins, the cervix begins to stretch and thin. This is called effacement and dilation. Days or hours before labor starts, your cervix may start to change position, pointing more towards the front. It will also soften, thin and shorten a little bit. As a result of these changes the mucus in your cervix may come out. This is called a bloody show. It looks jelly-like and may be stained with blood. During early labor, your cervix continues to open and widen, going from being closed to being 3 to 4 centimeters dilated. As you move into the active stage of labor, your cervix opens up even more, widening from 3 centimeters to about 7 centimeters. In the transitional or pushing phase, which is the final stage of labor, the cervix goes from about 8 centimeters and ends when it is fully dilated at 10 centimeters. This is one of the most painful parts of labor.</Content>

Pregnant women are routinely tested for gestational diabetes between 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy because it usually does not cause any noticeable symptoms. When symptoms are present they may include blurred vision, fatigue, and frequent infections, including those of the bladder, vagina, and skin. Women with gestational diabetes may also have increased thirst and increased urination. Some women also experience nausea and vomiting and weight loss despite having an increased appetite. If you have any of these symptoms, you should tell your doctor.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Can I stop intrauterine growth retardation or restriction (IUGR)?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Intrauterine growth retardation or restriction refers to poor growth of a baby while in the womb. A baby with this condition grows more slowly than usual and is smaller than normal at birth. It is ordinarily diagnosed during pregnancy through an ultrasound.

Although it is not possible to reverse intrauterine growth restriction you may be able to slow or minimize the effects by improving your nutrition and staying on bed rest to help improve the circulation to the fetus.

If the baby's health is in danger, the doctor may decide to deliver the baby early.

Many different things can lead to intrauterine growth restriction. Some risk factors that may contribute to this condition include:

&#8226; Alcohol abuse
&#8226; Smoking
&#8226; Drug addiction
&#8226; Clotting disorders
&#8226; High blood pressure or heart disease
&#8226; 	Kidney disease

<Content id="0">Placenta previa is when the placenta lies very low in the uterus and covers all or part of the cervix. It can cause painless bleeding during the second and third trimesters. Your doctor may recommend bed rest, and hospitalization may be required if bleeding is heavy or keeps occurring.

Placental abruption is when the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus before birth. This separation, or abruption, can be mild, moderate, or severe. If severe, the fetus cannot get adequate oxygenation and nutrients needed to survive. Placental abruption can cause bleeding, cramping, or uterine tenderness. Treatment depends upon the severity of the abruption and how far along the pregnancy is. Severe cases may require early delivery.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What do preeclampsia symptoms mean and what can I do?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Preeclampsia is when a pregnant woman has high blood pressure and signs that some of her organs may not be working properly.  This is a serious condition that can happen after the 20th week of pregnancy.

Most women with preeclampsia have healthy babies.  But if it's not treated, it can cause severe health problems for mom and baby.

The symptoms of preeclampsia include high blood pressure, protein in the urine,
severe headaches, and changes in vision, like blurriness, flashing lights, or being sensitive to light.

Other symptoms of preeclampsia are pain in the upper right belly area, nausea or vomiting, dizziness, sudden eight gain of 2 to 5 pounds in a week, and swelling in the legs, hands, and face.

If you have severe headaches, blurred vision or severe upper belly pain, call your doctor right away.

Most women with mild preeclampsia after 37 weeks of pregnancy don't have serious health problems, but your healthcare provider will usually want to deliver the baby to avoid further complications.

If you have mild preeclampsia before 37 weeks, your provider will check your blood pressure and urine regularly to make sure your preeclampsia doesn't get worse. You may be able to stay at home, or your provider may want you to stay in the hospital.

If you have severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks of pregnancy, you will need to stay in the hospital for close monitoring. Your provider may treat you with medicines to help speed up your baby's lung development and to control your blood pressure.

Currently, there is no sure way to prevent preeclampsia, but you should get good pre-natal care and follower your doctor's instructions about diet and exercise to minimize your risks.</Content>

It usually starts at around 6 weeks of pregnancy, reaches its worst at about 9 weeks of pregnancy. Most women start to feel better in their second trimesters. Some may have morning sickness throughout pregnancy. Mild morning sickness doesn't harm you or your baby. However, if it becomes severe it can lead to weight loss and dehydration, and this may be harmful. Tell your healthcare provider if you have severe morning sickness.

<Content id="0">Pregnancy can be nerve wracking experience, especially for first time parents.  Your body is changing quickly and every new sensation, ache or symptom can cause anxiety.  Every pregnancy is different, but most of what you will experience will be completely normal.  However, it is important to know when to call your healthcare provider or seek emergency help.

If you have enough vaginal bleeding to soak more than one sanitary pad an hour, clots or clumps of tissue passed from the vagina, or severe pain and cramps in the abdomen or pelvic region, call your healthcare provider or seek emergency help immediately.

Also, if you have a steady trickle or a rush of watery discharge during the second trimester of your pregnancy, you should let your healthcare provider know as soon as possible.

Other symptoms to look for are a sudden swelling of your face, hands, or feet, problems with your vision such as dimness or blurriness and severe headache, or fever.  If you experience any of these symptoms, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

If you are vomiting more than 3 times a day or are too nauseated to eat or drink, especially if you also have fever or pain, do not wait, let your healthcare provider know so that you can get help.

You may have milder symptoms that don't require emergency care but you should call your healthcare provider within a day if you have pelvic pain that doesn't get better or go away or pain that starts on one side and spreads across the belly.  Also contact your healthcare provider within a day if you have a fever over 100∞ Fahrenheit, severe or persistent vomiting and diarrhea, or fainting spells or dizziness.

Painful or frequent urination that is cloudy or bloody may be a sign of a urinary tract or bladder infection and should be reported to your healthcare provider.

Your healthcare provider also needs to know if you have swelling in your hands, fingers, or face, blurred vision or spots before your eyes, or severe headaches that last more than a few hours.

And, of course, report any vaginal bleeding or increase in your usual amount of vaginal discharge. You should also let your healthcare provider know if you notice changes in your baby's movement after 28 weeks.

You can wait until your next prenatal checkup to let your healthcare provider know about any slight spotting that goes away within a day, occasional twinges or pulling sensations in your abdominal area or any occasional mild headaches.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">My baby is not moving as frequently as before, should I be concerned?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Don't panic if your baby is not moving as frequently. Babies tend to move more at certain times of the day as they alternate between alertness and sleep. You may also feel fewer kicks after 32 weeks of pregancy, as your baby gets bigger and has less room to move around. If you think your baby isn't moving as often as it should, you can note the amount of time it takes your baby to make 10 movements. You should feel at least 10 movements within a two-hour period. If you don't feel your baby move 10 times by the end of two hours, try again later in the day. Then, if you still can't feel 10 movements in two hours, or your baby is much less active than normal, call your physician to have your baby's heart rate and movements checked.</Content>

<Content id="0">Almost three fourths of pregnant women experience constipation and other bowel issues in the first trimester. There are some things you can try to relieve this uncomfortable symptom. Eat a diet high in fiber. Pregnant women should try to eat 25 to 30 grams of dietary fiber a day. Stay well hydrated. Pregnant women should drink at least eight 12-ounce glasses of water a day. Break up your daily food intake into five or six smaller meals as well. Exercise stimulates your bowels, so get regular physical activity; but be sure to check with your doctor about what exercises are safe for you and your baby.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is implantation bleeding, and what are the symptoms?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Implantation bleeding typically occurs between 6 and 12 days after conception; this is when the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of your uterus. Some women may mistake it for their regular period because it can look similar and happen around the time you'd expect your normal cycle. However, implantation bleeding differs from a regular period. It lasts only 24 to 48 hours, and it tends to be light and usually brown, pink, or black in color. It is also very mild and is not associated with cramping. If the bleeding starts to look like a heavy period with blood clots and severe menstrual-like cramps, or if it is associated with tiredness or dizziness, it's important to contact your healthcare provider.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">An ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy when the fertilized egg implants somewhere outside of the uterus. It can attach to a fallopian tube, ovary, cervix, or in your abdomen. An ectopic pregnancy may start out with the usual pregnancy signs, but can cause damage to the part of the body it is attached to. This can lead to serious bleeding and even death. Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy include cramping, sudden, brief pain with tenderness, pain that starts on one side and spreads across the belly, or pain that worsens during a bowel movement or coughing. Abdominal pain or cramping combined with nausea and vomiting, pain in your shoulders, weakness or lightheadedness, or rectal pressure are also signs of an ectopic pregnancy, as are fainting and low blood pressure. Contact your healthcare provider or seek emergency care immediately if you have any of these symptoms.</Content>

Usually, it is safe to begin exercising a few days after giving birth or as soon as you feel ready, but always check with your healthcare provider to get the okay to start exercising. If you are nursing you should consider feeding your baby before exercising in order to avoid discomfort from engorged breasts. Also, make sure you keep hydrated while exercising.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How much weight should I gain during my pregnancy? And at what rate?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Your health care provider uses pre-pregnancy body mass index or BMI to figure out how much weight you should gain during pregnancy. Each woman will have a weight goal specific to her BMI, but It usually works out something like this:

Women at a healthy pre-pregnancy weight should gain 25 to 35 pounds, putting on one to four and a half pounds in the first trimester and then about one pound a week in the second and third trimesters.

If you were underweight pre-pregnancy you should gain about 28 to 40 pounds. That's a weight gain of one to four and a half pounds in the first trimester and then a little more than a pound a week in the second and third trimesters.

Women overweight before pregnancy, should gain about 15 to 25 pounds during pregnancy. Normally that is one to four and a half pounds in the first trimester and then a little more than one half pound every week in the second and third trimesters.

Don't worry if you gain a little more or a little less than you think you should in any week. You may have a few growth spurts when you gain several pounds in a short time, and then level off.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Can I work out during my pregnancy?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Working out will help you stay healthy and fit during pregnancy. Most healthy pregnant women can exercise, however there are some conditions that make exercising off limits during pregnancy. Always talk to your healthcare provider before starting or continuing any exercise program.

If you didn't work out before pregnancy start with a low level of exertion and work up to 30 minutes a day, three to five times a week.

If you exercised before pregnancy you should be able to continue to exercise at that same level during pregnancy, but you may have to modify your routine as your pregnancy progresses.

You should avoid any exercises lying on your back as well as sit ups, deep knee bends and toe touches; and, you should not perform activities with a high risk of falling.

When you exercise, drink lots of water and stop exercising and call your healthcare provider if you have any vaginal bleeding, dizziness, or trouble breathing while exercising.  Also, if you have headache, chest pain, pain or swelling in your lower legs, contractions, or if you start leaking amniotic fluid you should stop exercising and call your healthcare provider.</Content>

Keep in mind that your blood pressure does rise during weight bearing exercise, and your balance may also be affected.</Content>
