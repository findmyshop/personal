<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the factors behind a mental illness diagnosis?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Mental illnesses can be the result of several different factors and scientists believe that in most cases, a mental illness has more than one cause.  For instance, we know that mental illness may have a genetic connection, meaning that if someone is diagnosed with a mental illness, others in their family are more likely to experience mental illness.  We also know that traumatic events, such as natural disasters, violence, bullying or extreme stress can play a role in triggering the onset of mental illness.  Certain viruses can contribute to mental illness, especially when they affect fetuses and young children.  Substance abuse, toxins in the environment, and brain injury are also known to cause mental illness.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Common misconceptions of mental illness</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Among the greatest problems facing those who experience mental illness are the untrue beliefs that many people have about these brain disorders.   These untrue beliefs keep people from getting the help and support they need.  So, let's set the record straight.

The truth is:  mental illness is no one's fault.  Lack of information about the science of the brain led to mental illness being viewed as a problem of will power,  character, or even faith.

The truth is:  In most cases, people with mental illness who take their medication regularly and who do not abuse alcohol or other drugs are no more violent than people who do not have a mental illness.   The risk of violence increases when mental illness is left untreated.  And, as is true of everyone, with or without a mental illness, the risk of violence increases when someone is using illegal or street drugs such as crack, meth, cocaine, speed, and PCP.

The truth is: There is hope for people with serious mental illness.  People who get treatment for mental illness can lead full and productive lives.  Although it is sometimes difficult to find appropriate treatments and support, they do exist and ongoing research holds promise for new, more effective treatments with fewer side effects.

<BaseQuestion id="0">How is mental illness diagnosed?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There is currently no blood test, scan or other biological test to diagnose mental illness. Mental illnesses are diagnosed based on descriptions of symptoms, or clinical signs, which detail how a person feels, acts, behaves and thinks. The person having the symptoms most often gives the descriptions through a method known as "self-reporting", but it is also important for mental health professionals to get information from family members and others close to the person being diagnosed. It is important for mental health professionals to have as much information as possible when making a diagnosis.

The symptoms described are compared with details of each mental illness in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Illness or DSM. This manual is updated periodically, so it is common to refer to edition number for example, the DSM-5 when referring to the manual.

Because many mental illnesses have similar symptoms it can be difficult to get an accurate diagnosis, and getting the correct diagnosis is important for deciding what the best treatment is. If you feel that a diagnosis is not accurate, do not stop looking for the right diagnosis or treatment.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is bipolar disorder?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder in which people experience both episodes of depression and episodes of mania or hypomania.

Mania is a mood of excitement, euphoria, and over-activity that lasts for a week or more and causes a decrease in daily functioning. Hypomania is less severe and does not usually cause a decrease in functioning.

There are several different types of bipolar disorder that are defined by whether mania or hypomania is experienced. Bipolar type 1 includes periods of depression and mania. Bipolar type 2 includes periods of hypomania rather than mania.

For more information on Bipolar disorder, including how often it occurs and recommended treatments, see the Bipolar disorder Fact Sheet in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is borderline personality disorder?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Borderline personality disorder or BPD is characterized by impulsivity, doing things suddenly and without careful thought,  and instability in 		mood, self-image, and personal relationships.

	People with BPD can have mood swings including episodes of intense depression, 		irritability, and anxiety that last a few hours to a few days.  They often have problems with 	uncontrolled anger and impulsiveness.  Their impulsive behaviors can lead to 	overspending, substance misuse, dangerous driving and other risky activities.

	One of the key characteristics of BPD is the nature of the personal relationships that people 	with this disorder form.  Their relationships tend to be unstable and very intense, with 	extreme, "all good" or "all bad" views of people and experiences. Also, people with BPD 	have an intense fear of abandonment and will go to extreme measures to prevent it.

	Self-injurious behavior and suicidal threats are often a feature of BPD and people with the 	disorder have distorted views of their self-image and are uncertain about their own values 	and goals.

	For more information on BPD, including statistics on occurrence and recommended 	treatments, look at the Fact Sheet in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is major depression?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Major depression is not just feeling sad.  Unlike the feelings of sadness or loss which everyone experiences, major depression lasts from 6 months to a year and significantly interferes with thoughts, behavior, mood, activity, and physical health.

Major depression is common, it affects 9.9 million American adults, or approximately 5 percent of the adult population in
a given year and is the leading cause of disability in America.  It affects people of all income levels, races, and genders.

Common symptoms include:

&#8226; Deeply sad or irritable mood
&#8226; Changes in sleep, appetite, and energy not due to schedule changes or other health problems
&#8226; Difficulty thinking, concentrating, and remembering
&#8226; Physical slowing or agitation
&#8226; Lack of interest in activities that were once enjoyed
&#8226; Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, hopelessness, and emptiness
&#8226; Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide
&#8226; Persistent physical symptoms that are not due to other health problems such as headaches, stomach upset, and chronic pain.

Different people have different symptoms, and symptoms can vary based on sex, age, and culture, so be sure to look in the Resource Area for more information on major depression.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is postpartum depression?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Mood swings are a common and normal part of pregnancy and adjustment after giving birth.  Hormonal changes, stress, and lack of sleep among other things, can all contribute to feelings of moodiness and anxiety during pregnancy or the 2 to 3 weeks following delivery.  However, if mania, depression or anxiety last more than 3 weeks it may be due to a disorder that is commonly called postpartum depression. If untreated, postpartum depression may last for many months or longer.  Rarely, a more severe condition, called postpartum psychosis can occur.

Symptoms of postpartum depression include:

&#8226; Loss of appetite
&#8226; Insomnia
&#8226; Intense irritability and anger
&#8226; Overwhelming fatigue
&#8226; Loss of interest in sex
&#8226; Lack of joy in life
&#8226; Feelings of shame, guilt or inadequacy
&#8226; Severe mood swings
&#8226; Difficulty bonding with the baby
&#8226; Withdrawal from family and friends
&#8226; Thoughts of harming self or the baby

In postpartum psychosis, the thoughts and feelings of postpartum depression become so severe that the person experiences a break with reality.  Signs and symptoms of postpartum psychosis may include:

&#8226; Feeling removed from your baby, other people, and your surroundings, called depersonalization
&#8226; Disturbed sleep, even when your baby is sleeping.
&#8226; Confusion and disorientation
&#8226; Extreme agitation or restlessness.
&#8226; Hallucinations in sight, smell, hearing, or touch.
&#8226; Delusional thoughts, or thinking that isn't based in reality.
&#8226; Paranoia
&#8226; Attempts to harm self or baby

Postpartum psychosis requires immediate medical treatment. If you or your loved one have any psychotic symptoms, seek emergency help right away. There is a high risk of harm to self or baby if postpartum psychosis is not treated.

For more information on postpartum depression and psychosis, please see the links in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is schizophrenia disorder?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Schizophrenia is a psychosis, a type of mental illness in which a person cannot tell what is real from what is imagined.  It has a broad range of symptoms that affect the way a person thinks, acts, manages emotions, perceives reality, and relates to others.

The symptoms of schizophrenia disorder are described in three categories:

Psychotic symptoms include delusions and hallucinations. Delusions are ideas or convictions that the person truly believes in, but are not true, such as believing that aliens are stealing their thoughts. Hallucinations are seeing, feeling, smelling or hearing things that aren't there.  People with schizophrenia will often talk about the voices they hear in their heads.  These are called "positive" symptoms because they were not present before the onset of symptoms and so have been added to the person's behavior.

Negative symptoms describe missing behaviors and abilities.  These include lack of emotional expression, described as flatness, the inability to start and follow through with activities, speech that is brief and lacks content, and a lack of pleasure or interest in life.

Disorganized symptoms include confused thinking, speech and behavior that may not make sense. For example, people with schizophrenia sometimes may not make sense when they speak and have trouble carrying on conversations.  Sometimes they move very slowly or make repetitive movements such as walking in circles or pacing; and they may have difficulty making sense of things going on around them.

For more information on schizophrenia disorder including statistics and recommended treatments look for the Fact Sheet in the Resources Tab.</Content>

Panic attacks include 4 or more of these symptoms:  sweating; hot or cold flashes; choking or smothering sensations; racing heart; trouble breathing; shaking; chest pains; faintness; numbness; nausea; disorientation; or feelings of dying, losing control, or not being present in reality.

Many people have panic attacks at one time or another during their life, but that does not mean that they have a panic disorder.   Panic disorder is described as having four or more panic attacks in a four-week period, or recurrent or constant fears of having another panic attack.

Doctors often try to rule out every other possible alternative before diagnosing panic disorder because it mimics other ailments like heart attack and asthma.

For more information on panic disorder see the Fact Sheet in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is self-injury?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Self-injury, also called self-harm, is the act of deliberately harming your own body.  Self-injury is usually not meant to be a suicide attempt, instead it is a way of coping with extreme emotional pain, intense anger and frustration.  Self-injury is a symptom of mental illnesses such as borderline personality disorder, major depression and anxiety disorders.

The biochemistry of self-injury is complex.  The pain caused by the wounds releases "feel good" chemicals in the brain.  This produces a short-lived sense of calm well-being.   However, these good feelings are usually followed by guilt and shame on top of the return of the underlying negative emotions.

Examples of self-injurious behavior include:

&#8226; Burning
&#8226; Cutting the skin, sometimes to carve words or symbols
&#8226; Breaking bones
&#8226; Hitting or punching
&#8226; Piercing the skin with sharp objects
&#8226; Head banging
&#8226; Biting one's self
&#8226; Pulling out hair
&#8226; Persistently picking at or interfering with wound healing
&#8226; Picking or pulling out eyelashes

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is an anxiety disorder that can occur after someone experiences an event that caused intense fear, helplessness, or horror, like war, a hurricane, physical or emotional abuse or a bad accident.  It can result from personally experienced traumas or from seeing someone else experiencing a traumatic event.

Symptoms of PTSD include

&#8226; Nightmares
&#8226; Flashbacks, or feeling like the event is happening again
&#8226; Avoiding places and situations that remind you of the event
&#8226; Being hyper-alert to danger even in safe situations
&#8226; Excessive worrying, guilt, isolation or sadness
&#8226; Changes in sleep habits
&#8226; Frequent angry outbursts
&#8226; Thoughts of hurting yourself or others

People who have experienced a traumatic event may experience similar symptoms for a short while after the event, but with PTSD symptoms last longer than one month and affect daily functioning.  PTSD symptoms usually appear within three months of the traumatic experience; but they sometimes occur months or even years later.

Children with PTSD can have additional symptoms.  For more information on PTSD, look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Obsessive-compulsive disorder  or OCD is a disorder that causes recurring and stressful thoughts, fears or images called obsessions.  In an attempt to calm the anxiety and stop the obsessive thoughts, people with OCD perform specific actions or routines called compulsions.

Compulsions may be, excessive and repeated hand washing, counting things, repetitive thought patterns, checking and rechecking, hoarding, or arranging.  People with OCD feel they must perform these compulsive rituals or something bad will happen.

Examples of obsessions and the compulsions they drive might be "My hands must be contaminated; I have to re-wash them." or "I know I left the stove on: I have to go back and check".  To some extent, people with OCD know their obsessions are irrational but they cannot shake the anxiety the obsessions produce.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a mental health and substance abuse dual diagnosis?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A person with both severe mental illness and problematic drug or alcohol use is said to have a dual diagnosis.  It is a very common and particularly troubling problem because each disorder interferes with the treatment of the other.

For people with mental illness, drugs and alcohol can be a form of self-medication.  The temporary highs from substance abuse can ease the emotional pain of under- or un-treated mental illness but the underlying condition remains untreated and usually becomes worse.

Drug and alcohol misuse can cause a person who has no symptoms of mental illness to experience the onset of symptoms for the first time, and can worsen the symptoms of underlying mental illnesses.

The relationship between the two is complex, and the treatment of people with co-occurring substance abuse and mental illness is more complicated than the treatment of either condition alone.  Multiple scientific studies have shown that psychiatric treatments are more effective in people who are not actively abusing drugs and alcohol. Some treatment programs do not treat people who are actively abusing drugs or alcohol, and some require that substance abuse treatment take place at the same time as mental health treatment.  There has been a call for integrated treatment, in which treatment for the substance use is provided by the same team that is treating the mental health issues.  This can be helpful for people who are unable to remain sober but who need mental health treatment.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are eating disorders?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Eating disorders are characterized by preoccupation with food and weight issues.  People with eating disorders can focus on these issues so much that other areas of their life are negatively affected.  Without treatment, eating disorders can lead to serious, potentially fatal medical complications. Although eating disorders are commonly associated with women, men can develop them as well.  The three main types of eating disorders are:

Anorexia nervosa which involves denying oneself food to the point of self-starvation. A person with anorexia nervosa may deny that they are hungry and refuse to eat, severely restrict their calories, or they may vomit or use laxatives to purge after eating or exercise until they are exhausted to burn calories.

People with bulimia nervosa binge eat large amounts of food over a short time, and then vomit, use laxatives or excessive exercise to rid themselves of the calories.

Binge eating disorder or B.E.D. is losing control over eating habits and continuing to eat even when one is uncomfortably full. This excessive overeating leads to embarrassment, depressed or guilty feelings. Unlike anorexia or bulimia nervosa, a person with B.E.D. does not attempt to purge or exercise excessively after eating.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What should I do if I think I or my loved one has a diagnosis and is suffering?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">If you think that that you or a loved one has a diagnosable mental illness, that person should see a mental health professional for a diagnosis.  They should also see a primary care physician for a complete physical to rule out any physical causes for the symptoms of mental illness.  Thyroid conditions, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and other disorders can mimic the symptoms of mental illness.

The best way to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and appropriate treatment is found is to educate yourself.  We encourage you to explore the content on this site and to access the links in the Resource Area for additional information.

Through education you can support loved ones by understanding their illness, giving them the time and space they need to recover, and helping them to find the resources they need for treatment and daily living.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why is mental illness so difficult to diagnose?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">We are used to getting yes or no answers to questions about our health, you either have heart disease, or you don't, your blood glucose levels are either normal or elevated.  Diagnosing mental illness is not as clear.  No blood test, scan or other biological test currently exists to say whether or not a person is suffering from a mental illness, and even if the symptoms of mental illness are unmistakable, confusion exists because mental illnesses have different symptoms at different stages and many mental illness types and subtypes can share symptoms.

Also, mental health professionals often rely heavily on self-reporting of symptoms, which doesn't always present a complete picture of a person's behavior.  This is why it is so important for mental health professionals to hear from family members and others who share concerns over a person's behavior.</Content>

<Content id="0">You can help mental health professionals make an accurate diagnosis by making sure they get information from several sources.  Even if these sources do not fully agree on what is happening, it will help provide a complete picture and can prevent delays in diagnosis and treatment.    Also, record keeping can be extremely helpful in showing patterns of behavior.

We often hear that mental health professionals won't talk to family members of their patients because of HIPPA regulations.  However, HIPPA regulations do not prevent mental health professionals from listening to input from loved ones.</Content>

But, finding a mental health professional that is a good fit for you is key to getting an accurate diagnosis and treatment. Our members find that networking with other members can provide valuable first-hand information on providers.  Once you've made an appointment with a mental health professional, ask them about their approach to treatment.  If they don't seem comfortable answering your questions, you may want to look elsewhere.  In the Resource Area we've included a list of referral services as well as a list of characteristics to look for in determining whether a provider will be a good fit.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the warning signs for suicidal behavior?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">If you think that someone may be thinking of harming him or herself, do not be afraid to raise the subject with them. If you ask someone whether they ever think of suicide and they say yes, you must take it seriously.  Do not be afraid to ask for specific information about their plans.  There is a list of questions in the Resource Area that you can ask to determine whether someone is suicidal.

Some signs a person may be suicidal are:

&#8226; Threatening to hurt or kill him or herself
&#8226; Looking for ways to kill him or herself, such as seeking access to pills, weapons, etc.
&#8226; Talking or writing about death, dying or suicide
&#8226; Feelings of hopelessness, saying things like, "It will never get better" or "It will always be like this."
&#8226; Rage, anger or revenge seeking
&#8226; Acting recklessly or engaging in risky activities seemingly without thinking
&#8226; Feeling trapped, like there's no way out
&#8226; Increasing alcohol or drug use
&#8226; Withdrawing from friends, family or society
&#8226; Anxiety, agitation unable to sleep or sleeping all the time
&#8226; Dramatic changes in mood
&#8226; No reason for living, no sense of purpose</Content>

<Content id="0">If you feel someone may be a danger to self or others, do not hesitate to call 911. When you call 911, a dispatcher will answer and you will be asked to describe the situation. Let the dispatcher know that you believe a person with a mental illness is involved. Some police departments have Crisis Intervention officers and Psychiatric Emergency Response Team, or PERT teams who are trained to deal with mental health crises. Law enforcement officers will be sent to help. If they think that someone is a danger to themselves or others, options will include taking them to a psychiatric emergency room for assessment, or police custody. Many jails also provide psychiatric services.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can we prepare for a crisis?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">If you are an individual with a mental illness, you can prepare for crisis situations by making a Psychiatric Advanced Directive  or P.A.D., and completing a Wellness Recovery Action Plan, or WRAP, to let friends, family and other caregivers know what your wishes are should you be hospitalized or incarcerated.

Family and other caregivers can prepare by having crisis numbers at their fingertips and educating themselves about crisis response to mental health situations. Programs such as NAMI Family-to-family and Mental Health First Aid can help you prepare for dealing with crisis situations. We have included contact information and tips for handling crisis situations in the Resource Area of this page.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a psychiatric emergency response team? (PERT)</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The San Diego County Psychiatric Emergency Response teams called PERT, consist of specially trained officers and deputies who are paired with licensed mental health professionals. Together, they respond on-scene to situations involving people who are experiencing a mental health-related crisis and have come to the attention of law enforcement. The goal is to provide the most clinically appropriate resolution to the crisis by linking people to the least restrictive level of care that is appropriate and to help prevent the unnecessary incarceration or hospitalization of those seen.

PERT's primary purposes are:

&#8226; To provide clinical support to law enforcement and the community for calls involving persons having a mental health crisis via PERT teams.
&#8226; To provide education and training to law enforcement on issues related to mental health and mental health related crises.
&#8226; And to provide collaboration between law enforcement and the mental health system of care and mental health community.

There is an Emergency response plan you can complete and have handy for the PERT team. The plan is available in many languages on the PERT website.  You'll find a link to the site in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a mental health advanced directive?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A Mental Health Advanced Directive is also referred to as a Psychiatric Advance Directive or P.A.D.  A P.A.D. is a legal document written by a currently competent person who lives with a mental illness. It describes the person's mental health treatment preferences, and may name another person, called an agent, to make treatment decisions for the individual, should he or she become unable to make treatment decisions due to psychiatric illness. There are two kinds of P.A.D.s:

In Instructive P.A.D.s, the individual gives instructions about the specific mental health treatments the want if they experience a psychiatric crisis.

Proxy P.A.D.s name another person, called a health care proxy or agent who will make treatment decisions if the individual experiences a crisis that prevents them from being able to make their own treatment decisions.

For more information on P.A.D.s look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is involuntary hospitalization?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Individuals with mental illness who are in crisis and are a danger to themselves or others may need to be hospitalized against their will for their own protection.

In California a 5150, or 72-hour hold, means that someone who is in serious need of mental health treatment can be taken to a psychiatric hospital for evaluation and held for up to 72-hours.   Once they arrive at the hospital, a mental health professional will evaluate their condition and determine whether they should be admitted for further observation or care.

The law specifies that the evaluator must decide whether the individual can be properly treated without being detained.  If they determine that treatment and services can be provided without holding the individual against their will, they must provide them on a voluntary basis.

If the individual has been informed of the need for treatment, but it is determined by mental health professionals that they are not willing or able to accept treatment voluntarily, they can be held for 14 days.

If there is no immediate risk to life, a section 5200, or judicial hold, can be requested to hold a person who family or others believe needs a psychiatric assessment.  In this case, a pre-assessment by a mental health professional must be done to support the need for the hold and evaluation.

Mental health professionals perform an evaluation during the 72 hour hold and decide if they need to receive further treatment.  This is called a 5250.  In this case a certification review hearing must be held within 4 days of hospitalization to decide whether there is enough cause to continue with the 14 day hold.

<Content id="0">Friends In The Lobby volunteers are people who have been personally affected by mental illness in their families and have taken NAMI's Family to Family Class - 30 hours of free education which many describe as life-changing and integral to their understanding of their loved ones' mental health crises. They also undergo several hours of orientation training by NAMI San Diego.  They staff a resource table in psychiatric waiting rooms and provide assistance, support, and resources to family members during their time of crisis

In addition, NAMI San Diego's Next Steps program provides comprehensive, peer-based care coordination, brief treatment and health system navigation to adults with mental health and or substance abuse issues who present at the San Diego County Psychiatric Hospital  and other participating sites throughout the County. Support, education and advocacy will also be provided for families as a key part of the program.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What happens after a person is released from involuntary hospitalization?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Every individual who has been hospitalized has the right to an aftercare plan.   The hospital must arrange for the initial implementation of the patient's discharge plan.

Aftercare plans must address personal preferences, family relationships, physical and psychiatric needs, financial needs, housing needs, educational/vocational needs, social needs, accessibility to community resources, and indication of anticipated problems and how to deal with them.

Consistent with the confidentiality policies, the patient and caregivers must be counseled to prepare them for post-hospital care. And the hospital must transfer or refer patients, along with necessary medical information, to appropriate facilities, agencies, or outpatient services, as needed, for follow-up care or supportive services.

Look in the Resource Area for an aftercare-planning checklist.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What happens when someone is arrested?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">In San Diego County, registered nurses medically screen every person who is arrested before they are accepted into the jail system. Screening is done for emergency, acute, and chronic medical and mental health needs. Patients in crisis are seen immediately and other patients are seen as soon as possible, with 24 hour priority given to urgent cases.

If the screening indicates the possibility of a mental illness, professional nursing and social work staff will perform a full mental health assessment.  Assessments are also done if someone expresses an interest in getting psychiatric care or they have been identified as having previously received psychiatric service. Mental health professionals are also responsible for scheduling follow-up services and advising jail staff on placement or special housing requirements.

Personal medications are generally not administered in jail.  If the medical team determines that medication is needed it is provided through the jail pharmacy.  Medical staff accepts medical or mental health information.  To alert jail staff of someone's medication needs, call the jail information line and ask to speak to a medical staff member or use the medication forms in the Resource Area.

Jail staff must follow privacy laws and will not release medical or mental health information unless the incarcerated individual signs a "Release of Information" form which names the specific individuals who are allowed to be given medical information. Private doctors are not allowed to see people who have been arrested.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is mental health court?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Mental health court is a program that enables some individuals with mental illness who are arrested for non-violent crimes to be sentenced to treatment rather than jail.

Referrals to mental health court must be made by court officers and the individual must plead guilty to their crime and agree to fully participate in their treatment.

Each individual who is assigned to mental health court is provided with support such as adequate housing and health care, and access to therapy and medication, transportation, job training and education.  They are closely supervised to make sure that they adhere to the treatment plan that court employed mental health professionals prescribe.

The programs generally last 18 months and participants are on probation for 3 additional years.  Once they successfully complete their probation, they can apply to have their arrest record cleared.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I help my loved one who has been incarcerated?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Supporting a loved one who has been arrested can be extremely challenging and stressful. You can provide strong and effective support during this important time by doing the following:

When contacted by your loved one, stay calm and offer your support.

You can reassure them of the right to legal representation, and help with making contact with a lawyer if necessary. Attorneys familiar with mental health issues may be especially helpful.

Let your loved one know that a screening will be conducted for mental health issues, and that it is OK to discuss medical and mental health concerns with nursing and mental health staff. It is important that inmates feel safe to speak openly with these professionals.

It is important to obtain your friend or relative's booking number. If you speak with the inmate by phone, ask them to read the booking number printed on their wristband. You may also look up the booking number by checking the "Who's In Jail" feature on the Sheriff's Website. There's a link to this site in the Resource Area.

If release is unlikely to occur soon, and you are concerned about important information reaching medical and mental health staff, you may contact the jail and ask to speak to a member of the medical staff or complete an Inmate Medication Information Form which you'll find in the Resource Area.

Contact information for San Diego prison facilities is also listed in the Resource Area.</Content>

<Content id="0">Your family member may want to retain a private attorney or use the Public Defender's Office. A public defender will be assigned at arraignment if your relative does not have or cannot afford a private attorney. Do not be afraid to use a public defender. Public defenders often have knowledge of the system as it pertains to those who need mental health services.

If your family member decides to retain a private attorney, be sure to select one that is well versed in helping people with mental illness and understands how to access the treatment facilities and mental health services that are available.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a forensic psychiatric evaluation?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Forensic psychiatrists provide an objective opinion about the type and severity of an individual's mental illness to be used in making legal decisions.  They evaluate an individual's competency to stand trial or give testimony, and advise the court when an individual pleads not guilty due to mental illness and during sentencing recommendations. They may also be used to determine parental fitness or custody issues.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What treatments are there for mental illness?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Numerous treatments and services for mental illness are available and the majority of people diagnosed with mental illness that receive treatment experience relief from their symptoms.

Effective treatment for mental illness should address all aspects of the illness, including the biological, psychological and social aspects.  This bio-psycho-social model of treatment provides comprehensive treatment including medication, psychotherapy, and social supports.

Biological treatments address the level of chemicals in the brain that regulate emotions and behavior and include medications and non-pharmaceutical treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy or ECT.  They can also include exercise, nutritional support and other holistic treatments.

Psychological treatments address factors that influence emotional and behavioral functioning including feelings and thought processes, goal setting, and self-awareness. These can include Interpersonal Therapy, or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

Social supports and treatments address environmental factors such as family and relationships, employment, housing and education, and peer support.

The choice and combination of treatment and services depends on the type of mental illness, the severity of symptoms, the availability of options and individual preference.   Most people with mental illness report that a combination of treatments, services and supports works best to support their recovery.

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why isn't my loved one getting better?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">After a mental health crisis, it is normal for there to be a recuperation period.   Mental illness crises have real and lasting effects on physical and emotional well-being.  Because of this, it is important that during this period of recuperation, people who have had a mental illness crisis need to rest and avoid stress.  It is sometimes difficult for family and friends to understand these needs because their loved one looks fine, but in truth, they are physically and mentally exhausted.  The best thing that caregivers can do during this period is to learn about the mental illness affecting their loved one, to support them in finding and getting treatment, and to listen to them as they find their way back to a new normal.</Content>

<Content id="0">While medication can be an important part of symptom relief and recovery, there are many non-pharmaceutical treatments available as well.

Other non-pharmaceutical medical treatments include electroconvulsive therapy or ECT, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or rTMS, and  eye movement desensitization and reprocessing or EMDS.

Holistic treatments are non-pharmaceutical and address aspects of physical health that impact mental health.  Diet and exercise are considered holistic treatments for mental illness as are meditation and acupuncture.

Psychosocial treatments provide support, education and guidance to individuals with mental illness and their families.  These treatments address the whole lived experience of people with mental illness, including employment, housing, and social concerns. This can involve talking to a licensed therapist or participating in self-help and support groups, working with an employment counselor or a case manager.

<BaseQuestion id="0">Is medication necessary?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Medication is not the only treatment for mental illness, but for many it is an important one.  Medication can help relieve symptoms and stabilize moods so that individuals can recover.  While other non-pharmaceutical treatments are available and very effective, some people find that using medication is the only way they can continue to function and live their recovery.

Many people don't like the idea of taking medications, whether for mental illness or even a virus.  Some people see illness as a weakness, and taking medication as an admission that something is wrong.  Others find the side effects worse that the illness itself.

The decision to take or not take medication is a personal one, and this causes much frustration and concern for family members and other caregivers.  They may see their loved one who refuses medication spiraling out of control, losing their livelihood, family and friends, living on the streets or being incarcerated because of a mental illness that is treatable.  This is heartbreaking to watch.  Sometimes it is the lack of awareness that is a symptom of so many mental illnesses that keeps people from accepting medications.   On the other hand, individuals with mental illness may refuse medication for many valid reasons.  Side effects can rob individuals of their feelings, making them feel numb.  They can make individuals feel zombie like, cause tremors and ticks that are sometimes permanent, and contribute to metabolic syndrome which increases the risk for weight gain, diabetes and heart disease</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What medications are used to treat mental illness?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are several classes of medications used to treat mental illness. These medications may be used individually, or depending on the individual's symptoms and response to medications, they may be used in combination. Individuals with one disorder may be prescribed medications from a different class of medication to treat specific symptoms. For instance, anti-anxiety medications may be prescribed to someone with schizophrenia who is experiencing anxiety or to someone with bipolar disorder who is experiencing acute mania.

Anti-depressant medications work by raising the levels of chemical messengers in the brain that regulate mood. Some common types of antidepressants are SSRIs, and SNRIs. Older antidepressant medications like tricyclic and tetracyclic anti-depressants and MAO inhibitors are not used as much any longer because of their side effects and their potential as agents of suicide if taken in large doses.

Anti-anxiety medications now include the same medications used to treat depression for long-term treatment. People with anxiety disorders may also be prescribed an older class of anti-anxiety medications called benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are usually only prescribed for short-term symptom relief because of the risk of developing an addiction.

Mood stabilizing medications work to prevent the manic episodes of bipolar disorder and can help anti-depressant medications work to combat the depressive episodes. Mood stabilizers are often used in combination with medications from other classes.

Anti-psychotic medications reduce the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, which can include hallucinations and delusions. Older medications, called neuroleptics, did not do much to address the other symptoms of the disorder and have severe and often lasting neurological side effects. Newer antipsychotics, called atypical antipsychotics, are more effective at reducing symptoms, although some of them still have the potential to cause serious side effects.

It is very important to consult with your doctor if you are having side effects that may cause you to reduce or discontinue your medication. Side effects can sometimes be reduced or eliminated by adjusting doses or switching to a different medication.

<Content id="0">Medications that treat mental illnesses can have side effects, some of them severe enough to make people stop taking medications that are helping them cope with symptoms.

It is important to discuss side effects with your doctor before discontinuing or cutting back on medication because many symptoms can be reduced or eliminated with dosage adjustments or changing medications.

Discontinuing medications suddenly can potentially cause very serious withdrawal effects and should never be attempted without your doctor's approval.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is Assertive Community Treatment (ACT)?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Program of Assertive Community Treatment, or PACT is an intensive, multidisciplinary team that helps people who live with persistent mental illness, including co-occurring substance abuse, stay healthy and out of hospitals and jails.
They are available for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for at-home support at whatever level is needed, and for whatever problems that need to be solved. Rather than referring consumers to fragmented services, the PACT staff directly provides psychiatric, rehabilitation, substance abuse treatment, crisis intervention, peer support, and other support services.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the IHOT In Home Outreach Team?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">In-Home Outreach Team, or IHOT, is a free county wide program offering mobile teams that provide in-home outreach to adults with serious mental illness who are reluctant or resistant to receiving mental health services.

IHOT also provides support and education to family members and caretakers of IHOT participants.  Eligible individuals may have a co-occurring substance abuse diagnosis in addition to a diagnosis of a serious mental illness.

Each team includes a peer specialist, family coach, personal service coordinator or case manager, and a team lead. Peer specialists and family coaches draw upon their own personal lived experience in their work with participants, family members and caretakers.

Services provided by IHOT teams include, but are not limited to:

Behavioral health screening
Outreach and engagement
Crisis management
Transitional case management
Support and educational services
Linkage to community resources, such as healthcare and behavioral health services, advocacy groups, food banks, clubhouses, etc.

Participants may be referred to IHOT by family members, Psychiatric Emergency Response Team clinicians, hospital social workers, and jail or corrections personnel, NAMI San Diego, APS and other community support providers.</Content>

<Content id="0">Treatment plans should address all aspects of a person's life, including:

&#8226; Symptom relief through pharmaceutical or holistic interventions
&#8226; Psychological support for rebuilding the resiliency often lost with mental illness
&#8226; Social, educational and vocational support for re-entry into work, school and family life

An ideal treatment plan utilizes a combination of evidence-based practices--or treatment that is supported by scientific evidence, as well as carefully considered expert opinion and is consistent with the consumer and caregiver's personal values.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the relationship between physical and mental health?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The human body is a single organism comprised of many parts working together as one, with each part affecting and being affected by others. This means that while mental illnesses may involve chemical imbalances in the brain, the rest of the body can be affected as well. Mood and brain function are impacted by what we eat and drink, how much or how little exercise we get, the music we listen to and even the color of our walls! Sleep and mental health are closely related as well. Explore the links to the left to learn more about how mental and physical health are interrelated.</Content>

<Content id="0">Recovery from mental illness is an ongoing process, a way of life even, not an event like recovery from the chicken pox or a broken arm.  It takes vigilance, planning and a strong support system.  Many people use a Wellness Recovery Action Plan to help them stay in recovery.  Others refer to their Recovery Toolbox, an informal list of things that help keep them on track and instructions on how to find their way again should they encounter difficulties.  Listen to the experiences of these individuals in recovery and look in the Resource Area for information on Recovery tools and WRAP plans.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I create a social network and build healthy relationships?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">An important part of recovery is building a social network and healthy relationships with family and others. However, people with mental illness and their families are often isolated due to the nature of some mental illnesses and also due to stigma.

Support groups for consumers and family members can be a source of support from people who are experiencing the same things.

Drop in centers organize social events and provide a place where consumers can go to interact with others.  For a list of Drop in centers in San Diego County, look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How do I address financial concerns?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">People with serious mental illness often struggle to maintain consistent employment and can find themselves with reduced earning power and sometimes without any income altogether. There are resources available to those who have a serious mental illness who have been unable to find adequate employment.

The County of San Diego's Case Management services assist consumers with enrolling in financial assistance programs, including those that provide representative payee services, emergency housing, utility payments, rent subsidies and drug rehabilitation expenses. The programs are accessed through Behavioral Health Services, Adult Protective Services, and HIV/AIDS County of San Diego Case Managers only. Referrals must be made through County of San Diego.

Government Social Security programs like SSI and SSDI, and food stamps are available to those who qualify. To learn about the financial support available in your state and community and how to apply for it, contact your local Social Security Administration  field office. There are links to agencies and sites in the Resource Area.

People coping with illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder often need help with the complicated process of applying for the money they're entitled to receive.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Can people who have a mental illness work?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">People with mental illness can and do work! For many people who live with mental illness, having meaningful work is a vital step toward wellness.

After a mental health crisis, it can be difficult to re-enter the workforce and the nature of some mental illnesses make it difficult to maintain steady employment. Volunteering can be a good way to gain skills and do something that contributes to living a purposeful life.

There are many vocational services that help individuals in recovery find and keep a job. Vocational programs may offer social, vocational, housing, and other services and may provide work on-site for members, as well as transitional-employment programs to support them as they re-enter the competitive work force.

Supported employment helps individuals to learn marketable work skills at a real job of their choosing.

For example, Fountain House uses the Clubhouse Model of Vocational Rehabilitation to help individuals  operate a kitchen, administrative offices, housekeeping services, and programs in education, research, financial management, and other employment opportunities.

A transitional-employment program helps members learn job skills. Fountain House staff work closely with local hospitals and psychiatrists to coordinate members' medical treatment and assist when a crisis occurs.

The Mental Health Pathway programs train consumers and family members to work in the mental health field.

For more information on these and other vocational programs, look in the Resource Area of this page.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is Social Security?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Government programs can provide financial support to those who cannot work due to serious mental illness.

SSI or Supplemental Security Income is a federal program that provides income to those who are aged, blind, or disabled.  Eligibility is based on financial need and disability determination.  State Social Security programs may also provide small amounts of aid.

SSDI or Social Security Disability Insurance, is for disabled workers who have paid into the Social Security system through payroll deductions. Some disabled persons under age 22 may collect SSDI under a parent's account if the parent is retired, disabled, or deceased.

GPA or General Public Assistance, is available in some locations to those who are disabled and either ineligible or waiting for other assistance.

For information on these and other financial assistance programs available through the County of San Diego, look in the Resource section.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are Medicaid and Medicare?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Affording the costs of treatment for mental illness can be difficult, especially when income is limited. For those who cannot work or who do not have health insurance through their employer there are programs to help provide medical coverage. Medicare is a federal health insurance program for those over age 65 and disabled workers. Medicaid is a state and federal health insurance program for those with low incomes.

The state of California's Medicaid program is called Medi-Cal. This program pays for a variety of medical services for children and adults with limited income and resources.

Covered California is the new state-run marketplace or exchange for individuals, families and small businesses. Visit the site to find out if you and your family qualify for financial assistance in the form of a sliding scale to make coverage more affordable. You will be able to compare and choose the health coverage that best fits your needs and budget.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The Federal Americans with Disabilities Act requires that all people have a fair chance to work. The Act prevents businesses with 15 or more employees from discriminating against a qualified candidate on the basis of a disability, including mental illness.

Reasonable accommodations must be made for people with disabilities to help them be more productive at work. One advantage in discussing your mental illness with your employer is that it gives you legal coverage under the Americans with Disabilities Act. If you have trouble completing your work due to symptoms of your mental illness and have not told your employer about your disability, the company can take action against you for poor work performance, and you will not be protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

If you do decide to tell your employer about your mental illness it may be helpful to help educate them by providing fact sheets and information about your illness. You may also remind your employer of the reasons you were hired and show them that you are a valuable employee. If there are specific job tasks you find difficult to complete because of your mental illness, you can work with your employer to find reasonable accommodations that help you fulfill your job responsibilities.

You may also want to review your employer's policies about leave with or without pay. Asking for help from your employer can be difficult, but working together can provide benefits for both of you. By law, your employer must respect your right to privacy and offer a fair chance for you to pursue a career.

If you feel you have been discriminated against, contact your local Equal Employment Opportunity Commission office. Links to more information about the Americans with Disabilities Act are listed in the Resource section.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I return to the world of work after a crisis?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">In addition to your treatment plan, recovery may include activities that help you feel successful and productive. These activities may include hobbies, volunteer work or vocational training. Finding work in a setting that meets your personal needs can be an important part of helping you feel like a part of your community. Sometimes people need to learn new skills or relearn lost or forgotten skills. Practicing these skills in a supportive and safe place such as a drop-in center, advocacy center or Clubhouse program may be a good stepping-stone in recovery. In these places, you can work on social skills, practice working with others, follow a schedule and learn to work within your own limits and energy level. The best part of these activities is that you'll be working with others who understand what you are going through. For some people, a side effect of their illness is that they lose certain skills or cannot think as clearly or quickly as before. This  can lead to feelings of frustration or loss for those who can't easily return to their former work life. If this is the case for you, it's important to recognize those feelings. It won't happen overnight, but there are things you can do to help you prepare to return to work. Programs exist to help you find your strengths and help you successfully search for a job</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Mental Illness in Older Adults Overview</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Even if someone has never had a mental illness before, they can still be diagnosed with a treatable mental illness as an older adult.  Mental illness in older adults can be difficult to recognize.  Family members, health professionals and even older adults themselves can easily miss the symptoms or dismiss them as a normal part of aging.  Many older adults are reluctant to seek help because they are ashamed or afraid of how a diagnosis might affect their independence.

Mental illnesses that are common in older adults include depression, dementia, and anxiety.

Mental illness in older adults is treatable and with appropriate treatment many see their symptoms alleviated.  Listen as these professionals talk about mental illness in seniors then use the links to your left to explore the topic further, or type your own question into the box.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why is it difficult to diagnose mental illness in older adults?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Mental illnesses share symptoms with other age-related illnesses like heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer.  Additionally, depression can be influenced by the health issues and financial difficulties that older adults often face. Because of this, medical professionals and older adults themselves often believe that their symptoms of depression are a natural result of these worries. This, in turn, can lead to many older adults affected by mental illness going undiagnosed and untreated. It is important to become familiar with the signs of mental illness in adults and be aware of changes in mood, eating and sleeping patterns.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is depression in older adults?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Depression is considered the most common mental disorder in adults over the age of 65. The symptoms of depression, especially trouble concentrating, confusion, memory issues and irritability or worry, are often thought to be a normal part of aging or the onset of dementia. In fact, some experts believe that up to 10 percent of those diagnosed with dementia actually have depression. Be aware of changes in mood or eating and sleeping habits, uncharacteristic irritability, anxiety, feelings of worthlessness or guilt and changes in activity levels or interest in favorite activities.

It is important to rule out other physical causes for changes in behavior because they can also signal health issues such as heart disease, problems with the thyroid and other glands or other illnesses. Medications can also cause some of the symptoms of depression so make sure to tell your doctor about behavior changes noticed after any change in medication.</Content>

There are many different types of dementia, each of which has different causes but similar symptoms, including Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, caused by stroke or long term high blood pressure as well as dementia with Lewy bodies caused by protein deposits in the brain. Other forms of dementia are caused by long term excessive alcohol use, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. Often dementia is caused by a more than one of these disorders.

Older adults who become forgetful, disoriented or confused should be evaluated by a mental health professional and medical doctor because there are some reversible conditions that have the same symptoms as dementia. Side effects from medications, medication interactions or overdoses, poor diet and other physical illnesses can look like dementia.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is anxiety in older adults?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Doctors and older adults tend to view anxiety and fear as normal given the circumstances of aging. But developing an anxiety disorder late in life is not a normal part of aging.

Studies estimate that anxiety disorders affect between 3 and 14 percent of older adults in a given year. More women than men experience anxiety disorders. They tend to be less common among older adults than younger adults.

Anxiety caused by stressful events like moving or losing a job is a normal part of life. But anxiety disorders are different. An anxiety disorder lasts a long time and can get worse if it is not treated.

Anxiety disorders commonly occur at the same time as other illnesses. In older adults, anxiety disorders often occur at the same time as depression, heart disease, diabetes, and other medical problems. In some cases, these other illnesses need to be treated before a person will respond to treatment for the anxiety disorder.</Content>

<Content id="0">Alzheimer's disease is a brain disease that causes brain cells to die, initially impacting memory then as it moves to other areas of the brain, affecting cognitive skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out everyday tasks. Although at present there is no known cure, there is a small but growing number of treatment options available, most of which are aimed at slowing the loss of brain cells.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the relationship between physical and mental illnesses in older adults?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Many of the physical illnesses common in older adults co-occur with mental illnesses like anxiety and depression.  Some of the symptoms of these common illnesses can also mimic those of mental illness or dementia.  Likewise, the side effects of medications commonly taken by older adults can have side effects that mimic those of mental illness, especially in the case of drug interactions or overdose.

Heart or lung disease can affect behavior when there is not enough oxygen getting to the brain.  Diseases of the glands, such as the thyroid, adrenal, pituitary or pancreas can cause problems regulating emotion, perception, memory and thinking.

Poor nutrition can also contribute to symptoms of mental illness in older adults.  If the body is not getting adequate nutrition, it can affect behaviors.  Too little sugar in the bloodstream can cause confusion and personality changes, while conditions like pernicious anemia, caused by problems absorbing vitamin B12, can cause irritability, depression and dementia.

Physical issues related to aging, such as dental problems can contribute to poor nutrition, and lack of exercise due to limited mobility can cause depressed mood and irritability.</Content>

<Content id="0">You may be surprised to learn that suicide rates among adults 65 and older are higher than the rate for the national population. The group with the highest suicide rate is white males 85 and older.

While the many life changes that come with aging can cause anyone to feel down or out of sorts, some people are not able to recover from these feelings like they might have at other times in their lives.</Content>

<Content id="0">Treatment for mental illness in older adults is consistent with treatment for other age groups.  Medications can be effective and it is important to tell all healthcare providers about all medications and supplements to avoid drug interactions.  Side effects should be closely monitored as well.

Psychotherapy is effective as well, and a combination of medication and therapy has been shown to be very effective in reducing the recurrence of depression in older adults.</Content>

<Content id="0">There are many things loved ones can do to support older adults who either have a risk of developing or are currently living with mental illness.

Loss of a loved one, loss of independence, isolation, lasting complications or pain stemming from medical conditions, economic lifestyle changes, the stress of caring for a disabled spouse, the lack of the robustness of youth, or a combination of these and other factors increase the risk of mental illness and suicide in older adults.

Inform your loved one's caregivers of any changes in behavior or mood that you see and make sure physical causes for these changes are ruled out by medical professionals.

Pay close attention to mood and provide extra support during transitions, such as changes in housing arrangements, new illness diagnoses or treatment, or changes in mobility and independence. Also, make sure that healthcare professionals are asking about suicidal ideation and monitoring mental health during these periods as well.

Take steps to ensure the senior in your life is not left bereft and feeling alone. Visit often. Interact by playing games, dining together, or simply talking. Frequent visits help determine if seniors are doing well. Interacting provides the opportunity to look for and gauge the signs listed above in an unobtrusive way. If you can't visit yourself, look into volunteer or paid services where your loved one lives to find a companion who can visit them. Some facilities have programs to keep older adults active and engaged, and there are community programs that they can take part in as well if they are living on their own.

Also you can help your older loved one stay safe from phone and internet scams by educating them on how to protect their privacy.

Look in the Resource Area for more information on supporting older adults and for a list of programs for older adults in San Diego County.</Content>

<Content id="0">Children and adolescents with serious emotional or mental impairments face particular challenges, as do their parents and caregivers. Mental and emotional impairments can look different in children and adolescents than they do in adults and there are many questions about appropriate treatments and medications.

If you are a child or adolescent who has or thinks you may have an emotional or mental impairment, you are not alone. We have information and resources for you on common problems faced by others who have been where you are.

If you're a parent of a child or adolescent with emotional or mental impairment, you may be feeling overwhelmed. Parenting a child with a mental or emotional impairment means trying to navigate the mental health system and the education system all while maintaining a stable home and caring for yourself and others.

Listen to these next few videos, then continue to explore this topic by asking your own questions, or by using the links to your left.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is mental illness or severe emotional disturbance in children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">While there has been discussion about whether our society is diagnosing normal childhood behavior as emotional or mental impairment, the facts speak for themselves.

In children, severe emotional disturbance is a term that describes disorders in children and adolescents that have difficulty functioning at home or in school or community settings.  These disorders are thought to be related to underlying conditions such as mental illnesses or environmental traumas such as physical or emotional abuse or neglect, out-of-home placement, brain injury, exposure to drugs and alcohol or to violence.

13% of youth aged 8-15 live with emotional disturbance severe enough to cause significant impairment in their day-to-day lives. This figure jumps to 21% in youth aged 13-18.

50% of all lifetime cases of severe emotional disturbance begin by age 14 and 75% by age 24.

Early detection and treatment of severe emotional disturbance is important.  Research into childhood emotional disturbances has shown that intensive early treatment may in some cases lessen the effects of the disorders and, in some cases, prevent serious mental illnesses from developing altogether.  Unfortunately, the average delay between onset of symptoms and intervention is 8-10 years. Only 50% of youth with diagnosable disorders receive treatment.

As a results, approximately 50% of students aged 14 and older with a severe emotional disturbance drop out of high school--the highest dropout rate of any disability group.

70% of youth in state and local juvenile justice systems have a diagnosable emotional or mental health impairment, with at least 20% experiencing severe symptoms.

Severe emotional disturbances that affect children and adolescents include but are not limited to anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorders, childhood-onset bipolar disorder, early onset depression, early onset schizophrenia, eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder or A.D.H.D.

<BaseQuestion id="0">Who should I talk to if I think my child or adolescent may have a mental illness?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">If you think your child may have an emotional or mental impairment talk to your child's primary care doctor about your concerns, and describe what you have seen.  If they confirm your feelings that there is a concern, then you can work toward getting your child the help they need.

As part of the diagnostic process a comprehensive physical examination should be done to rule out other physical conditions that may be causing a child's symptoms.  They should also be evaluated for substance use problems, learning disabilities, sensory integration problems, and other physical or mental disorders, that may cause behavioral problems or poor school performance.    You can also ask your child's school to do diagnostic testing to help with a diagnosis.

Once other causes for concerning behavior have been ruled out a mental health provider that specializes in childhood mental illness should be consulted. Your child's primary care physician may be able to refer you to a mental health professional.  You can also ask for referrals from families involved with NAMI San Diego or other advocacy organizations.  To find a child psychiatrist, visit the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry website.  The link is listed in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What can I do to support my child?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">You can support your child or adolescent by helping them find an accurate diagnosis and effective treatments.
Getting an accurate diagnosis takes time and can be a frustrating process for the individual and family.  During this process it is important to focus on finding effective interventions to address the individual's symptoms.

If emotional or mental illness interferes with a child's education, schools are required to provide special education and related services in the school setting.  Families and teachers should work together to find effective interventions, accommodations, and supports that promote positive behaviors, academic achievement, and prevent challenging behaviors in school.  NAMI's Parents and Teachers as Allies program promotes mutual understanding and communication between families and school professionals.

For some children, having a diagnosis is scary and they may be resistant to accept it.  Others are relieved to know that what is happening to them is caused by an illness, that they are not alone, and that there are treatment options that can make them feel and do better.

 It is important to find ways to use the strengths and interests of your child to help him or her cope with difficult symptoms. Activities like exercise, martial arts, music, and art can be extremely beneficial.   Ask your child's mental health professional to recommend effective interventions, skills training, support groups, and other options that can help your child cope with symptoms and develop the skills necessary to ultimately lead a full and productive life.

You can also support your child by educating yourself about mental illness.  The NAMI Basics education class empowers parents and caregivers to be affective advocates for their children.

<BaseQuestion id="0">Is medication use safe for children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There has been much concern about the use of psychotropic medications or medications to treat mental illness.  Little research has been done about the long term effects of these medications.

Psychotropic medications for young children should be used only when anticipated benefits outweigh risks. Parents should be fully informed and decisions made only after carefully weighing these factors. Children and adolescents must be closely monitored and frequently evaluated as the side effects common to some medications can be particularly difficult for children. At the same time, psychotropic medications can be lifesaving.

Medications are only part of a treatment plan which affects the biological causes of mental illness.  Even with medication mental illness can continue to affect an individual's life so it is important to address the psychological and social aspects of mental illness as well.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the treatments for mental illness in children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Effective treatment for mental illness should address all effects of the illness, including the biological, psychological and social aspects.  This biopsychosocial form of treatment provides a comprehensive plan that addresses all areas of functioning.

Treatment for children and adolescents with mental illness or severe emotional disturbance is often provided in the school setting as part of an individualized education plan or IEP.   Behaviors that interfere with learning are addressed with positive behavioral interventions, strategies, and supports. Psychological or counseling services may also be provided through the school as part of the IEP.

Psychological treatments work by helping people with mental illness understand their illness and by teaching them how to deal with stress and unhealthy thoughts and behaviors.  Activities like sports or physical exercise such as martial arts, music or art are recommended to help build on the strengths and interests of your child and to help him or her cope with difficult symptoms.  A healthy diet, regular exercise and adequate sleep are also an important part of treatment.

Medication may be part of a child or adolescent's treatment plan, but because the effects of psychotropic medications on still developing brains are unknown, some people are hesitant to consider them as a first line treatment.  Be sure to discuss medication use with your child's mental healthcare provider.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What do I need to know about my child's medication?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">All medications, even aspirin, have side effects.  When medications are prescribed it is important to understand all of the potential benefits and risks of the medication, as well as options for alternative or complementary treatments.

It is also important to understand how the medication works, and how long it takes for it to be affective.

Determining the best dose of a medication and whether it is effective requires close observation by the prescriber, the individual taking the medication and family or others who are in a position to observe behaviors such as teachers.

For this reason it is important to schedule follow up visits within two weeks of starting the medication and monthly until symptoms are improved and stabilized.

If a child or adolescent has taken medications to treat mental illness over an extended period of time and they are doing better, it is important to cautiously try to decrease the medication to the lowest effective amount.  This process should be managed by a doctor.  It is important not to suddenly stop taking a medication because this can cause serious adverse effects.  Talk to your child's doctor before making any changes to medication.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are anxiety disorders in children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Anxiety disorders are a group of disorders that cause people to feel excessively frightened, distressed, and uneasy during situations in which most others would not experience these symptoms. They are the most common mental illnesses in America affecting as many as one in 10 young people.

Left untreated Anxiety disorders in children can lead to poor school attendance, low self-esteem, deficient interpersonal skills, alcohol abuse, and adjustment difficulty.

There are several types of anxiety disorders common in children and adolescents:

Panic disorder is characterized by panic attacks sudden feelings of terror that strike repeatedly and without warning. Symptoms can include chest pain, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, abdominal discomfort, feelings of unreality, and fear of dying. Children and adolescents with this disorder may experience unrealistic worry, self- consciousness, and tension.

Post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD is caused by trauma such as emotional or physical abuse or neglect, exposure to violence, or other traumatic experiences. Symptoms include nightmares, flashbacks, the numbing of emotions, depression, feeling angry, irritable, and distracted; and being easily startled.

Generalized anxiety disorder is described as exaggerated worry about every day, routine life events and activities that lasts at least six months or more. Children and adolescents with this disorder usually anticipate the worst and may also complain of fatigue, tension, headaches, and nausea.</Content>

<Content id="0">Autism spectrum disorders are a group of disorders that interrupt childhood development, resulting in problems with communication, social skills stereotyped or repetitive behaviors and interests, sensory issues, and in some cases, cognitive delays.  Its characteristic symptoms include awkwardness in social situations, intense preoccupation with specific, often unusual topics, lack of understanding of social cues, an extreme need for routine and structure, and clumsiness caused by lack of motor coordination.

The autism spectrum disorders include autism, Asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders or PDD.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is childhood onset bipolar disorder?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Individuals with bipolar disorder experience mood swings that alternate from periods of severe highs called mania to the severe lows of depression.  However, while these abnormally intense moods usually last for weeks or months in adults, children with bipolar disorder can experience such rapid mood swings that they commonly cycle many times within a day. The most typical pattern of cycling among children with bipolar disorder is called ultra-ultra rapid or ultradian.  This cycle features low energy in the mornings followed by increases in energy towards late afternoon or evening.

Many parents report that their children have seemed different since early infancy. They describe difficulty settling their babies, and they note that their children are easily over-responsive to sensory stimulation. Sleep disturbances and night terrors are also commonly reported.

Children having a manic episode commonly

Feel very happy or act silly in a way that's unusual
Have a very short temper
Talk really fast about a lot of different things
Have trouble sleeping without feeling tired
Have trouble staying focused
Talk and think about sex more often
Do risky things.

Children and teens having a depressive episode may:

Feel very sad
Complain about pain a lot, like stomachaches and headaches
Sleep too little or too much
Feel guilty and worthless
Eat too little or too much
Have little energy and no interest in fun activities
Think about death or suicide</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a dual diagnosis of mental illness and substance abuse in children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Many teens with mental illness attempt to self-medicate with street drugs and alcohol.  In fact, the combination of mental illness and substance abuse is so common that many clinicians now expect to find it.  Studies show that more than half of young persons with a substance abuse diagnosis also have a diagnosable mental illness. Families and caregivers know how difficult it is to find treatment for an adolescent who abuses drugs or alcohol but also is diagnosed with a mental illness.

Traditionally, programs that treat individuals with brain disorders do not treat individuals with active substance abuse problems, and programs for substance abusers are not geared for people with mental illness. Adolescents are often caught in this treatment or services gap.

Treatment for mental illness is more effective when there is no substance use involved, however, new treatment models integrate mental health and substance use treatment.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is early onset depression?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Children, and especially adolescents experience normal mood swings in reaction to things around them.  But depression is more than the sadness over a bad day or the normal cycle of coping that we all experience with major loss such as the death of a love one or pet.

Depression is a brain disorder that affects the whole person--it affects the way one feels, thinks, and acts. Early onset depression can lead to school failure, alcohol or other drug use, and even suicide. However, it is highly treatable.

Signs of depression in children and adolescents include

&#8226; Persistent sadness and hopelessness
&#8226; Withdrawal from friends and from activities once enjoyed
&#8226; Increased irritability or agitation
&#8226; Missed school or poor school performance
&#8226; Changes in eating and sleeping habits
&#8226; Indecision, lack of concentration, or forgetfulness
&#8226; Poor self-esteem or guilt
&#8226; Frequent physical complaints, such as headaches and stomachaches
&#8226; Lack of enthusiasm, low energy, or low motivation
&#8226; Drug or alcohol abuse
&#8226; Thoughts of death or suicide

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is early onset schizophrenia?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that interferes with thinking and perceptions.  The main feature of schizophrenia is psychosis or losing touch with reality.   Symptoms of schizophrenia usually begin in late adolescence or early adulthood; schizophrenia with an onset prior to age 18 is less common, and onset of the disorder before age 13 is exceedingly rare.

Diagnosing schizophrenia in children can be difficult for several reasons.  The early symptoms emerge gradually and may be attributed to typical developmental stages, other mental illnesses or developmental delays.

An additional difficulty in making a diagnosis in children and adolescents relates to the fact that hallucinations, one of the hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia, are surprisingly common, and, in fact, are most often seen in children and adolescents with diagnoses other than schizophrenia.  Many children with other conditions such as mood disorders and dissociative disorders, report auditory hallucinations when they are under stress.

Children with autism spectrum disorders such as autism or Asperger's disorder, often have social difficulties, disorganized behavior and language impairments, and can be misdiagnosed as having schizophrenia.

If your child has any of the following symptoms, you should consult a medical professional.  Having one or more these symptoms does not mean that your child has schizophrenia; it only means that an evaluation should be done to determine if there is a diagnosable condition that can be treated.

In younger children:
&#8226; Language delays
&#8226; Late or unusual crawling
&#8226; Late walking
&#8226; Other abnormal motor behaviors -- for example, rocking or arm flapping are signs that a child should be evaluated

In older children and adolescents:
&#8226; Withdrawal from friends and family
&#8226; A drop in performance at school
&#8226; Trouble sleeping
&#8226; Irritability or depressed mood
&#8226; Lack of motivation
&#8226; Strange eating rituals
&#8226; Shows excessive suspicion of others
&#8226; Shows a lack of emotion or shows emotions inappropriate for the situation
&#8226; Has strange ideas and fears
&#8226; or, has violent or aggressive behavior or agitation

Seek medical attention immediately if you notice your child

&#8226; Delusions, or beliefs not based on reality
&#8226; Hallucinations or seeing or hearing things that don't exist, especially voices
&#8226; Disorganized or illogical thinking
&#8226;Speech that doesn't make sense</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are eating disorders in children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Eating disorders are characterized by preoccupation with food and weight issues.  Although many people want to be thin and take healthy steps to lose weight, people with eating disorders focus on these issues so much that other areas of their life are negatively affected.  Without treatment, eating disorders can lead to serious, potentially fatal medical complications. Although eating disorders are commonly associated with women, men can develop them as well.  The three main types of eating disorders are:

Anorexia nervosa, which involves denying oneself food to the point of self-starvation. A person with anorexia nervosa may deny they are hungry and refuse to eat, or they may vomit or use laxatives to purge after eating or exercise until they are exhausted to burn calories.

People with bulimia nervosa binge eat large amounts of food over a short time, and then vomit, use laxatives or excessive exercise to rid themselves of the calories.

Binge Eating Disorder or B.E.D. is losing control over eating habits and continuing to eat even when one is uncomfortably full. This excessive overeating leads to embarrassment, depressed or guilty feelings. Unlike anorexia or bulimia nervosa, a person with B.E.D. does not attempt to purge or exercise excessively after eating.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD is a disorder that causes recurring and stressful thoughts, fears or images called obsessions.  In an attempt to calm the anxiety and stop the obsessive thoughts from the obsessions, people with OCD perform specific actions or routines called compulsions.

Examples of obsessions are "My hands must be contaminated; I have to wash them" or "I know I left the stove on" or even "I'm going to hurt myself." To some extent, people with OCD know that their obsessions irrational but they cannot shake the anxiety that the obsessions produce.

Compulsions may be excessive and repeated hand washing, counting things, checking and rechecking, hoarding, or arranging.  People with OCD feel they must perform these compulsive rituals or something bad will happen. The onset of OCD symptoms may occur as early as age three or four, but very young children and parents may not recognize the symptoms.  OCD effects children and adolescents during a very important period of social development. Schoolwork, home life, and friendships are often affected.

Some children with OCD are too young to realize that their thoughts and actions are unusual. They may not understand or be unable to explain why they must go through their rituals. But older children may feel embarrassed and may hide their rituals when in front of friends at school or at home and become mentally exhausted from the strain.  Some may find their rituals so time-consuming that they are too tired to play with friends or concentrate in school. OCD in children often exists concurrently with motor tics or Tourette's syndrome.

Approximately one million children and adolescents in the United States suffer from OCD. This can mean three to five youngsters with OCD per average-sized elementary school and about 20 teenagers in a large high school.  OCD is as or more prevalent than many other, better known childhood ailments.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, is an illness characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.

There are different types of ADHD:

Those with the predominantly inattentive type often fail to pay close attention to details or make careless mistakes in schoolwork, work, or other activities; have difficulty sustaining  attention to tasks or leisure activities; do not seem to listen when spoken to directly; do not follow through on instructions and fail to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace; have difficulty organizing tasks and activities; avoid, dislike, or are reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort; lose things necessary for tasks or activities; are easily distracted by extraneous stimuli; are forgetful in daily activities.

Those with the predominantly hyperactive or impulsive type often: fidget with their hands or feet or squirm in their seat; leave their seat in situations in which remaining seated is expected; move  excessively or feel restless during situations in which such behavior is inappropriate; have difficulty engaging in leisure activities  quietly; are "on the go" or act as if "driven by a motor"; talk excessively;  blurt out answers before questions have been completed; have difficulty awaiting their  turn; interrupt or intrude on others.

Those with the combined type, the most common type of ADHD, have a combination of the inattentive and hyperactive or impulsive symptoms.

<BaseQuestion id="0">Is my child or adolescent at risk for suicide?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">If you feel that your child is in danger, call 911 immediately.  Suicide is a serious concern in children and adolescents and having a mental illness does increase the risk of suicide.   For youth between the ages of 10 and 24, suicide is the third leading cause of death. It results in approximately 4600 lives lost each year. The top three methods used in suicides of young people include firearm, suffocation, and poisoning.

Parents and caregivers should be aware of the risk factors which include

&#8226; History of previous suicide attempts
&#8226; Family history of suicide
&#8226; History of depression or other mental illness
&#8226; Alcohol or drug abuse
&#8226; Stressful life event or loss
&#8226; Easy access to lethal methods
&#8226; Exposure to the suicidal behavior of others
&#8226; Incarceration

Parents and caregivers should also be aware that there are protective factors that reduce risk of suicide as well, including

&#8226; Skills in problem solving, conflict resolution and handling problems in a non-violent way
&#8226; Strong connections to family, friends, and community support
&#8226; Restricted access to highly lethal means of suicide
&#8226; Cultural and religious beliefs that discourage suicide and support easy access to a variety of clinical interventions
&#8226; Effective clinical care for mental, physical, and substance use disorders
&#8226; Support through ongoing medical and mental health care relationships</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How do I talk to my child about suicide?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are things you can do to reduce the risk of suicide.

If you believe that someone you know may be thinking about harming themselves, talk to them.  Talking to a friend or family member about suicidal thoughts and feelings can be extremely difficult, but don't be afraid to ask directly whether or not they are thinking of hurting themselves.  You cannot make a person suicidal by showing that you care. In fact, giving a suicidal person the opportunity to express his or her feelings can provide relief from loneliness and pent-up negative feelings, and may prevent a suicide attempt.

&#8226; Talk in a calm, non-accusatory manner
&#8226; Let them know you love and care for them
&#8226; Convey how important they are to you
&#8226; Focus on concern for their well-being
&#8226; Make statements that convey you have empathy for their stress
&#8226; Encourage seeking professional help
&#8226; Reassure them that they will not feel like this forever</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Is it safe for my child with mental illness to use the internet?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Parents are often concerned about the impact of the internet on their child's well-being.  One of the issues involves misinformation--how do you make sure your child is getting accurate information?  Another concern is the effect of chat rooms and whether their use encourages individuals to get help or may possibly encourage harmful actions.  Cyberbullying is also of great concern, as is the social isolation that some believe the internet promotes.

As with any new technology, there are both pros and cons.

Individuals who access information about their condition from reliable sources on the internet are more likely to seek help from mental health professionals.

Many express that they have found a social network through social media that they are not able to find outside the internet.

The most important thing is to talk to kids about their internet use and make it part of the discussion about their mental health.  Point them to sites with accurate health information and discussion sites that are moderated by professionals.    Acknowledge that there is harmful information on the internet and talk about what to do if they encounter someone who is bullying them or advocating harmful behaviors.

Look in the Resource Area for more information on internet use and mental health as well as information on safe internet use for children, using parental controls, and protecting privacy on social media.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the age of consent for mental health treatment?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The age of consent for mental health treatment in California is 12.  This means that individuals 12 years of age or older can make mental health treatment decisions for themselves, including whether to take medications, participate in treatment, and let mental health professionals share information with parents and other caregivers.

This is a source of frustration for parents who are trying to get their child the help they feel is needed.  However, minors who abuse drugs or alcohol or suffer from emotional or psychological problems may avoid seeking care if they must involve their parents.

There are some limits to confidentiality. If a doctor or nurse learns that a teen under 18 years is being abused, or is thinking about hurting themselves or others, the proper authorities must be contacted for help.

As a parent, part of your job is helping your child learn how to make healthy decisions. Becoming more independent and making their own choices is an important part of growing up.  Make sure you let them know you are always there to help, even if you do not agree with all their decisions. Listen, and when possible, stay calm if they come to you with a problem that is upsetting, so they will continue to talk to you.

Also, remember that although medical professionals may not be able to talk to you about your child's treatment, there is nothing in the law that says they can't listen to your concerns.   Work with your child's treatment team to make sure they have a complete picture of what is happening at home and at school.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is an individualized education plan (IEP)?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">An Individualized Education Plan, also called an IEP, is a written contract with the school district stating the plan that will be followed to educate your child once the child has been evaluated and determined to have a disability that interferes with their education, such as a severe emotional disturbance or mental illness.

The IEP should be reviewed at a meeting that includes parents. This plan should include a description of all special education services your child will be receiving, yearly goals, and transition plans for adolescents who have reached age 16.

Special education services for youth with emotional or mental impairment may also include psychological or counseling services.

Requests for an IEP from your child's school district must be in writing.  Look for links to more information on this subject in the Resource Area.</Content>

<Content id="0">Services for children and adolescents whose education is affected by emotional disturbance or mental illness are provided through Individualized Education Plans or IEPs in the school environment.

If a child does not have an IEP, community services for children and adolescents with mental illness are provided through the Children Youth and Families area of Behavioral Health Services or CYF.  This agency offers a wide variety of services, from early intervention to residential services, through direct, county-operated agencies, and through contracts with community-based providers and individual fee-for-service providers.  For more information on mental health services available for children and adolescents, look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a conservatorship?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A mental health conservatorship, called an LPS conservatorship names a family member or other adult as caregiver for an adult who cannot take care of themselves due to serious mental illness.  The caregiver is then called the conservator.

The conservator has the duty to take care of and protect the person with mental illness and to make financial decisions for them.  The conservator can give consent to mental health treatment, including the use of medications used to treat mental illness, but the person with mental illness may still physically refuse to take the medications.

The conservator can also agree to place the person with mental illness in a locked facility if a psychiatrist says it is needed and the hospital agrees to take the person.

The Court will not let you establish an LPS conservatorship unless it finds beyond a reasonable doubt, that the person is gravely disabled. Gravely disabled means that, because of a mental disorder, the person cannot take care of basic, personal needs for food, clothing, or shelter.

An LPS conservatorship only lasts one year. About 90 days before it expires, the LPS clerk in the Probate Court Clerk's Office will mail the conservator a notice of expiration.  If you need to, you can petition to renew the conservatorship. Otherwise, it will end. This means that the adult with mental illness is free to make their own decisions, and to refuse treatment.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How is mental illness diagnosed in children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Mental illness diagnoses are made based on professional observation and evaluation, information provided by your family and other experts, and the criteria found in the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This evaluation should include a comprehensive look at all aspects of your child's life in school, with family, with friends, and in the community.   The provider evaluating your child is likely to ask you to fill out a checklist that provides a detailed profile of your child and the challenges your child is facing.

It may take several visits with a mental health professional before a diagnosis is made.  The diagnosis may also change as new symptoms emerge or existing symptoms change. A diagnosis must be confirmed over time and thus ongoing two-way communication between the treating provider and the family is necessary to track and monitor the child's condition and progress.   Families should not hesitate to seek a second opinion if they are not confident in their child's evaluation and the diagnostic process.  Getting a second opinion can be challenging because of the shortage of children's mental health providers.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the difference between ADHD and childhood onset bipolar disorder?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Childhood Onset Bipolar Disorder or COBPD is a mood disorder that is sometimes mistaken for ADHD.  The differences in children who have childhood onset bipolar disorder are subtle. Destructive behaviors are common to both disorders but these behaviors often seem intentional in those with COBPD and caused more by carelessness or inattention in those with ADHD.

Physical outbursts and temper tantrums, also features of both disorders, are triggered by sensory and emotional over-stimulation in those with ADHD, but can be triggered by limit-setting, or even a simple "No" from parents of those with COBPD.

Furthermore, while those with ADHD seem to calm down after such outbursts within 15 to 30 minutes, those with COBPD often continue to feel angry, sometimes for hours. It is important to note that children with COBPD are often remorseful following temper tantrums and express that they are unable to control their anger.

Other symptoms, such as irritability and sleep disturbances, often accompanied by night terrors with morbid, life-threatening content, are commonly seen in those with COBPD but are rarely associated with ADHD.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What do I do if a peer of my child commits suicide?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The suicide of a friend or peer is often a traumatic experience for adolescents and the death of one teen might influence other teens feeling suicidal.   The suicide of a well-known celebrity or personal idol can have a similar influence on depressed young people.

Talk to your child about what happened and emphasize the dangerous consequences of the deceased's behavior and about the importance of seeking help.  Ask them who they would go to if they had a serious problem, but don't be upset if you aren't on the top of the list.  Provide suggestions for others they may go to--family members, school staff or other trusted adults.  Above all, make sure that they understand the importance of sharing problems and getting help.

Keep the lines of communication open and check back with your child periodically to see if they have any unasked questions or concerns; and be aware of the risk factors and warning signs of suicide.

For more information on how to talk to your child about the suicide of a peer, look in the Resource Area of this page.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Does online therapy work?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Technology is making great changes in treatment for mental illness. Individuals can now receive therapy from a licensed professional via the web, live chats or email. There are applications that support Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, track bipolar mood episodes and even virtual reality simulations which aim to provide controlled exposure therapy to those with anxiety disorders.

The effectiveness of these technologies is still being examined, but if they are proven to be effective, they may open the door to more accessible treatment for people with mental illness.

When exploring online treatments, look for reputable providers and discuss the options with your mental health professional.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I better communicate with my loved one?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Many mental illnesses come with cognitive overload, or the inability to think clearly, which makes it difficult for everyone to communicate with each other.  We fall into ineffective patterns of communicating around the symptoms of mental illness.  In order to communicate effectively, we need to state our needs and concerns openly and we need to allow our loved one to do the same.

Two communication methods are especially helpful in restoring healthy communications among family members and loved ones with mental illness.

"I" statements express clearly and directly how you feel or think or what you want.  They put the focus on the speaker and dispel tones of judgment and blame that can be heard in statements that begin with "You".

Reflective statements mirror back to the person the emotions they are expressing.  For instance if a person says that they don't want to take their medication because it causes weight gain, you might reflect back "I can see why it would bother you to be putting on more weight."   After letting your loved one know that you are listening and can empathize with their feelings, it is much easier to discuss the problems they are having and to come up with solutions that meet everyone's needs.

Family-to-Family class members learn about communication skills and role play conversations.  For more information on communication skills, look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can families solve problems as a team?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">When a family member has a mental illness, the rest of the family is faced with a myriad of problems that seem to have no solutions.  The sheer volume and repetitiveness of the issues can be overwhelming.  The key to problem solving is  first agree on what the main problem is, to define it clearly, and then to brainstorm solutions with others.   It is often helpful to enlist members of other families in this exercise to learn from their experiences.

NAMI's Family-to-Family class features a problem-solving workshop that demonstrates a model that can be used to structure problem-solving discussions.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What keeps people from seeking treatment?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">One of the most heartbreaking dilemmas facing the families of people with mental illness occurs when their loved one refuses to get treatment.

There are many reasons why people with serious mental illness refuse treatment. People who are symptomatic may not even realize that they have a mental illness. Another reason is the stigma of being a person with a mental illness. Mental illness is often seen as a weakness or failure, sometimes even by individuals with mental illness themselves. This keeps people from acknowledging that they are ill and from accepting the help they need to feel better. Side effects from psychotropic medications can be serious, and that, in the eyes of the person who is taking them, outweigh the benefits.

As family members or caregivers, we can learn to empathize with our loved one's reasons for refusing treatment and can work with them to reduce stigma and to find better medications with fewer side effects.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why does my loved one continue to have behavioral difficulties even after treatment?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">As would anyone whose sense of stability and safety has been shattered, people who have a mental illness can act in ways that seem baffling to family and friends, but make perfect sense for someone who is trying to preserve what sense of self they have left.

These behaviors, called defensive coping strategies, are used by all of us at times, but for people whose sense of self is always at risk due to mental illness, they can become standard behavior.

Recovery is a process that takes time and support.  People in recovery are learning more positive coping skills but may at times fall back on defensive coping strategies.   Understanding the pain underlying these actions can help family, caregivers and friends better respond to them.   Continued therapeutic support as well as the support of friends and family can help individuals with mental illness in their recovery.

Defensive coping strategies include:

&#8226; Self-absorption
&#8226; Irritability
&#8226; Haughtiness
&#8226; Controlling/manipulation
&#8226; Anger and attack
&#8226; Rejection of friends and family
&#8226; Blaming others
&#8226; Defensiveness
&#8226; Drug and alcohol abuse
&#8226; Doing nothing
&#8226; Resistance to change
&#8226;Refusing services
&#8226; Denial
&#8226; Apathy
&#8226; Suspicion
&#8226; Dependency
&#8226; Abusive criticism of others
&#8226; And avoidance, or "I don't want to talk about it."

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the signs of a relapse?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">People with a mental illness and their family and caregivers can learn to recognize the early signs and symptoms of a relapse. These signs and symptoms may differ from one person to another and from one mental disorder to another, but common ones include:

&#8226; Changes in mood.
&#8226; Losing one's sense of humor.
&#8226; Tenseness, irritability, or agitation.
&#8226; Difficultly concentrating
&#8226; Social withdrawal
&#8226; Saying or doing irrational or inappropriate things
&#8226; Neglecting personal care
&#8226; Discontinuing medication
&#8226; Unhealthy changes in sleeping or eating patterns
&#8226; Increasing suspiciousness or hostility
&#8226; Sensitivity to noise or light
&#8226; And, hearing voices or seeing things that other people cannot see or hear

If you notice or suspect any of these signs and symptoms, contact a doctor, psychiatrist, or other mental health provider as soon as possible.</Content>

<Content id="0">As family members, caregivers or friends of someone who has been diagnosed with mental illness, we go through an emotional reaction to learning about their diagnosis that is not unlike the reaction to losing a loved one.  We may feel grief and denial at first, then become angry or feel guilty, and finally we come to acceptance and understanding.  These reactions are normal and it is important to be able to express these emotions to others in a safe, non-judgmental environment.  Family support groups can be a great place to find others who have been through what you're going through.  Understanding our own emotional reactions and the reactions of others can help family members better support each other and their ill loved one.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why won't my child take medication?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Just like adults, children and adolescents may balk at taking psychotropic medications, and for the same reasons.  Many are troubled by the side effects or don't like the way the medication makes them feel.  For others, taking medication for a mental illness means that they are sick, different, or crazy.  This is self-stigma and it keeps many people from getting help.

The question of whether you can force your child to take medication is a difficult one.  Forcing a struggling child to take any medicine can lead to vomiting or choking.  Hiding medication in food or drink can destroy trust.

Talk to your child about their refusal to take medication and find out what their objections are.  Addressing the underlying issues or side effects, either with different dosages, different medications, or other avenues can help.   Sometimes making the case for medication to treat specific issues that are not necessarily related to mental illness, like sleep or appetite problems, can help as well.

Additionally, your child's treatment provider may be able to provide additional strategies to help ensure your child takes their medication as prescribed.</Content>

<Content id="0">After you have asked your school district to evaluate your child, you should be notified when the tests are complete and the school psychologist is prepared to share the findings. The results should be reviewed at an evaluation team meeting, which you must be invited to attend. The evaluation report will indicate if your child needs special education. It may also recommend the types of programs and services your child needs. Under the law, if it is determined that your child is eligible for special education services, those services must be provided at public expense, and under public supervision and direction from highly qualified teachers. Keep in mind, however, that the report may indicate that your child is ineligible and does not need a special education program.  You may have the right to appeal this decision.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is stigma?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Stigma is viewing someone in a negative way because they have an illness or condition.  For people with mental illness and their families stigma is everywhere--it can even come from ourselves.

Stigma is when our loved ones with mental illness are excluded from social activities, job opportunities, and education.  It is in the media where people with mental illness are portrayed as violent criminals.  It is in the social services system that is ill-equipped to meet the needs of people with mental illness.

And stigma is when people with mental illness don't want to get treatment or take medication because they believe these negative views themselves.  Or, when family members blame themselves for a loved one's mental illness.

There is much you can do to help fight stigma.  For more information look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is recovery language?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Language is important.  How we speak about mental illness can dispel stigma and stereotypes or reinforce them.  Recovery language is person focused, putting the emphasis on the person and their strengths rather than their illness.  For instance, we use the phrase "individuals with mental illness" rather than mentally ill individuals.  We talk about a person having schizophrenia rather than a "schizophrenic person."   When talking about symptoms we talk about what the person is experiencing, so rather than saying that someone is delusional, we say they are having delusions.  For a guide to using recovery focused language, look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<Content id="0">Family members and caregivers are very important to the recovery of people diagnosed with mental illness.  They take on the many challenges of supporting the physical, emotional and social well-being of their loved ones, and they most often do so with no formal education on mental health.  NAMI San Diego offers several programs to help caregivers support their loved ones with mental illness.  Listen as these family members tell you what they've learned, then you can ask your own questions or select information from the links to your left to explore this topic further.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I help support my loved one with mental illness?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Individuals with mental illness describe three ways that family and other caregivers can best help them.

First, learn about the illness. Understanding the lived experience of our love ones with mental illness helps us to put their behaviors and struggles in perspective.

Second, help them get effective treatment and social supports.  Often individuals with mental illness do not have the energy or focus that is sometimes needed to navigate insurance companies, medical systems and social services We can help them by advocating for them and tracking down available resources. This can be especially challenging when we don't agree with our loved ones on what treatment is appropriate.  At times, our loved ones may not be able to act in their own best interest and there may even be times when your loved one's life depends on getting them treatment against their will.

And third, listen to their concerns and feelings with an open mind. Withhold judgment and advice, unless it is asked for, and give them the time and space to recuperate, and rebuild their life.

NAMI San Diego has a number of programs that can help you learn to support your loved one. Look in the Resource area for more information.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What should I do if my loved one won't accept help?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">It can be extremely frustrating for families and caregivers when they and their loved one with mental illness do not agree on a treatment plan. Some people with mental illness have difficulty following a recommended treatment plan, whether due to the side effects of medication, stigma, or even denial or lack of awareness about their illness.

This is especially difficult when our loved one's treatment choices lead to relapse or crisis.  In these situations, caregivers may need to make difficult but life-saving decisions about their loved one's care and treatment.

Family members should not give up hope. Studies show that people with mental illness who have strong support systems, including family members, have greater success in their recovery efforts. But you also have to make sure that your own needs are being met. Always remember to  balance your advocacy for your loved one with acts of loving kindness for yourself to avoid the risk of caregiver burn out.

Look in the Resource Area for suggestions on self-care to prevent caregiver burn out.</Content>

<Content id="0">The stigma around mental illness can isolate individuals and their families, eroding the social support systems that we come to depend upon to help us through other crises.

The Family-to-Family educational program and family support groups are great ways to build a supportive network of people who are experiencing the same struggles.

You can also call the NAMI San Diego Helpline or one of the important numbers on this page.

For more information on these programs, look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can diet help with recovery?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Everyone benefits from a healthy diet, but it can be especially important to individuals with mental illness.  What we eat affects our energy level, brain functioning and mood.  A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and seafood; and low in processed, refined foods optimizes mind-body health.   Some people also benefit from supplements such as B-vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids.

For more information on healthy eating, look at the links in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How does exercise help with recovery?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Exercise is extremely beneficial for mental health, and in fact may be considered one of the most effective non-pharmaceutical treatments for depression.

Not only does physical exercise improve brain functioning, reduce depression and anxiety, it has other beneficial effects.

Individuals living with mental illness often have a higher risk for medical illnesses such as heart disease, obesity,  and diabetes.  Exercise can help prevent these conditions.

And exercise doesn't need to be strenuous to be beneficial.  Studies have shown that movement of any kind can be very effective, even if it is only for a few minutes a few times each week.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What impact does sleep have on recovery?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Lack of sleep has a profound effect on the brain. Sleepiness slows down thought processing, impairs memory, makes learning difficult, and slows reaction times.

But most importantly, it affects mood, causing irritability and anger, and one's ability to cope with stress. Sleepiness also interferes with activities that improve wellness, like exercise and relaxation. If fact, chronic sleepiness puts you at greater risk for depression.

For more information on sleep and mood, look in the Resource area.</Content>

<Content id="0">Mindfulness is a mental state reached by focusing awareness on the present moment, and acknowledging and accepting one's feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations. This can be an especially helpful tool for individuals with mental illness as it can help to calm anxiety and racing thoughts.

Mindfulness is a common beneficial technique that can be practiced by anyone at almost any time, and there are many ways to practice it. Meditation, deep breathing, guided imagery, yoga and tai chi are all forms of mindfulness.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What medical disorders can co-occur with mental illness?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">When a person has two or more illnesses at the same time, it is called comorbidity.  Mental and physical illnesses are often co-morbid.  More than 68 percent of adults with a mental disorder have at least one medical condition as well.

It is important to consider comorbid disorders because they lead to increased symptoms, decreased day-to-day functionality, decreased length and quality of life and increased healthcare costs. The connection between comorbid conditions is complex--medical disorders may lead to mental disorders, mental conditions increase risk for some medical disorders, and mental and medical disorders may share common risk factors.

Holistic models that treat the whole patient, mind and body, have been shown to provide the most effective treatment for comorbid physical and mental conditions.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is metabolic syndrome?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Metabolic syndrome is a group of related conditions; increased blood pressure, a high blood sugar level, excess body fat around the waist and abnormal cholesterol levels.  Having these conditions together greatly increases your risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.

Individuals with mental illness could be at increased risk for metabolic syndrome for many reasons, including poverty and reduced access to medical care.  Metabolic syndrome is also a side effect of some medications used to treat mental illness, such as some antipsychotic drugs.

For this reason, individuals with mental illness and healthcare providers should be aware of the risks of metabolic syndrome and make treatment plans accordingly.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are peer support programs?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Peer support programs provide assistance with recovery goals. In peer support programs, individuals with mental illness who have achieved significant recovery, called peer support specialists, assist others with mental illness in their recovery. Along with other trained professionals, peer support specialists act as role models and provide support and information. Research shows that individuals who participate in peer support programs have more successful and longer lasting recovery experiences. Peer support programs incorporated into state and local mental health programming reduce hospitalizations and emergency interventions.

For information on peer support programs in San Diego County, look in the Resource area of this page.</Content>

<Content id="0">NAMI's Principles of Support are guidelines for peer support groups designed to empower participants and allow all participants to share their experiences and learn from each other in a safe and confidential environment.  The principles are:

&#8226; We will see the individual first, not the illness.
&#8226; We recognize that mental illnesses are medical  illnesses that may have environmental triggers.
&#8226; We understand that mental illnesses are  traumatic events.
&#8226; We aim for better coping skills.
&#8226; We find strength in sharing experiences.
&#8226; We reject stigma and do not tolerate discrimination.
&#8226; We won't judge anyone's pain as less than our own.
&#8226; We forgive ourselves and reject guilt.

<Content id="0">NAMI's Ending The Silence is a 50 minute program that is devoted to giving school-age students an opportunity to learn about mental illness through presentation, discussion, and personal testimony. The students learn symptoms and indicators of mental illness, and are given ideas about how to help themselves, friends, or family members who may be in need of support. The program is delivered by a two person team including a trained consumer-presenter who shares his or her own journey with mental illness, and can relate to the student population. Students are given a resource card with valuable phone numbers and websites for mental health agencies, along with a list of symptoms and warning signs.</Content>

<Content id="0">Family-to-Family is a free 12 week course taught by trained family members of individuals living with mental illness. It provides critical information and strategies related to care-giving through read-alongs,  presentations, discussion and exercises. The Family-to-Family course was designated an Evidence Based Practice in 2013 by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The study conducted by the National Institutes of Mental Health showed that Family-to-Family participants had:

&#8226; Significantly greater overall empowerment as well as empowerment within their family, the service system and their community;
&#8226; greater knowledge of mental illness;
&#8226; a higher rating of coping skills;
&#8226; lower ratings of anxiety related to being able to control conditions; and
&#8226; higher reported levels of problem-solving skills related to family functioning.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How does mental illness affect men and women differently?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are many differences in how mental illness affects men and women. Depression, anxiety, personality disorders and substance abuse occur and are diagnosed at different rates in men and women. Men and women with the same condition may have very different symptoms and experiences, and they may deal with their symptoms differently. An individual's gender may also determine what access they have to mental health treatment and the types of treatment they receive.

For instance, men and women tend to deal with anxiety differently, which results in different rates of diagnosis. Women more often internalize stress, leading to withdrawal, loneliness and depression. Men are more likely to externalize stress, which results in aggressive, impulsive, coercive and noncompliant behavior.

Men with depression may feel irritable and tired and they may have more trouble sleeping than women with depression. They are also less likely to seek help for their symptoms. Men are also less likely to attempt suicide, but more likely to die by suicide.

Women are more likely to be diagnosed with depression than men, even when they have the same symptoms, and they are more likely to be prescribed psychotropic medications.

For more information on the role that gender plays in mental illness, look in the Resource area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How does mental illness affect people of different ethnicities?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Cultural differences affect many aspects of mental illness, including rates of prevalence, symptom presentation, attitudes about and access to care, and even reactions to medication.

Many minority ethnicities experience greater environmental stressors in the form of violence, financial difficulty, homelessness and incarceration. These stressors increase the incidence of depression, anxiety and substance abuse. Immigrants from other cultures face the additional stresses of language barriers and adapting to a new culture.

Symptomology of many ethnic groups include more somatic or physical complaints, and some cultures do not differentiate between physical and mental illnesses.

Ethnic minorities are sometimes misdiagnosed because of these differences and also because of the cultural bias on the part of mental health providers.

Cultural bias and distrust of mainstream mental health providers as well as limited, access restrict the levels of care that many ethnic minorities get. Also, some ethnic minorities react differently to psychotropic medications, which sometimes results in over-medicating.

For more information on mental health and different ethnic communities, look in the Resource area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How does mental illness affect individuals in the LGBTQ community?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Because of the stigma attached to homosexuality, individuals in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning or LGBTQ community, face additional stressors that can increase their risk of mental illness. In fact, LGBTQ people experience anxiety, substance use and mood disorders at more than twice the rate of the general population.

LGBTQ adults are more often the victims of physical or verbal violence due to their sexual orientation and LGBTQ children and adolescents experience more bullying.

Because of the added stigma that our society places on homosexuality, LGBTQ individuals with mental illness are less likely to have the support of their family to help them in their recovery.

For more information on mental health issues in the LGBTQ population, look in the Resource area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is NAMI?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The National Alliance on Mental Illness in San Diego is the city's voice on mental illness. We are part of the grass-roots, non-profit, national NAMI organization founded in 1979 by family members of people with mental illness. We are also an affiliate of NAMI California.

We have a threefold mission:

To support people with mental illnesses and their families by helping them find coping mechanisms for their daily struggle with brain disorders.

To educate people who have mental illness, their families, and the general public about mental illness with the goal of dispelling ignorance and stigma.

 And, to advocate for more research and an improved system of mental health services across the nation.

At the heart of NAMI San Diego's mission is the sharing of information and striving to end the stigma associated with mental illness. To this end, we offer a Helpline, support groups, educational meetings, newsletters, a lending library and a number of classes on mental illness held at various locations throughout San Diego County.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are mania and hypomania?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Mania is a state of extreme energy and can be felt as irritability or agitation or as euphoria and intense well-being.  People who are experiencing a manic episode often have a reduced need for sleep, are very talkative and may talk faster than usual.  Feelings of invincibility can lead to greater risk taking behaviors and excessive spending.

Hypomania is a less severe form of mania.  People experiencing hypomania may feel extremely confident, productive and energized, but they are able to carry on day-to-day activities normally.

Hypomania crosses into full mania when there is loss of the ability to perform daily functions or an individual experiences psychosis.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I find myself or my loved one a place to live?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Depending on the individual's needs and income, there are many types of housing facilities and programs.

Private housing options include housing complexes that are affordable for individuals with low incomes, and the Section 8 Rental Assistance Programs which assist low-income households with rent subsidies so that their housing costs are lowered.

Independent living facilities are shared living environments that provide structure and fellowship for individuals who can manage their own medications and daily living tasks, and do not require supervision.

Single Room Occupancies, or SRO hotels, are typically single room units with a bed, small refrigerator and a microwave. These units can be affordable because they offer lower rents and usually do not require security deposits or first and last month's rent.

Residential care facilities, sometimes called Board and Care, are licensed facilities that are appropriate for individuals who need assistance with medication management or other supervision.  These facilities provide 24/7 care and supervision to residents.

There are also a number of emergency living arrangements provided through shelters and motel voucher programs.

For more information on housing options, click on the related questions or look in the Resource Area for a directory of housing resources.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is crisis housing?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Crisis housing facilities include emergency shelters, transitional shelters, motel vouchers, and winter shelters.

Emergency shelters offer a temporary overnight sleeping accommodation. The maximum stay varies depending on the program. Case management is sometimes available to clients.

Motel voucher programs shelter eligible families, disabled and elderly persons in participating motels throughout the County. Eligibility requirements vary from year-to-year; typically, the voucher programs require that clients present evidence that they are not able to stay in a traditional homeless shelter; and, they will be able to obtain permanent housing within approximately 3 to 4 weeks.

Winter Shelters provide short-term emergency winter shelter in order to accommodate the higher demand for shelter during the colder months. The winter shelter programs generally include temporary emergency shelter for veterans, single individuals, and families with children. The winter shelter programs usually operate from mid-December through mid-March.

Transitional Shelters offer housing, case management, and support services to return people to independent living, as soon as possible, often within 6 months, and usually not longer than 24 months.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are independent living facilities?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Independent living facilities are usually privately owned and provide a shared housing environment for adults with mental illness and others who benefit from a shared housing environment.   Independent living facilities may not be licensed or include supervision, but they provide structure and fellowship for residents. They may also provide meals, laundry facilities, and cable and phone services.  Stays can be long term, but independent living facilities are not permanent housing.

Though independent living is unlicensed, the County established Independent Living Association homes or ILAs.  Owners of private living facilities who become members of ILA must maintain a higher quality of standards for their facilities. Independent living is appropriate for individuals who can care for themselves and manage their own medication.

<Content id="0">The Section 8 Rental Assistance Programs assist low-income households with rent subsidies so that their housing costs are lowered. The two Section 8 rental assistance programs are:  Housing Choice Voucher Program and Moderate Rehabilitation Program.

Participants of the Housing Choice Voucher  or HCV, Program are responsible for finding a rental unit that meets program guidelines. All assisted units are inspected to ensure that they are in decent, safe, and sanitary condition at the time of move in, and are re-inspected yearly. Under the HCV Program, a monthly rental assistance payment is issued directly to the landlord. The amount of assistance is determined by housing costs and participant income.

The Moderate Rehabilitation program provides assistance for specific housing units only. The County notifies individuals on the Moderate Rehabilitation waiting list of vacancies in the Moderate Rehabilitation units.  Individuals living in Moderate Rehabilitation units remain on the Section 8 waiting list so they can receive Section 8 rental assistance in the future. When individuals place their names on the Section 8 waiting list, they can request to be placed on the Moderate Rehabilitation list as well.

For more information on these programs, including eligibility requirements, look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the factors behind a mental illness diagnosis?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Mental illnesses can be the result of several different factors and scientists believe that in most cases, a mental illness has more than one cause.  For instance, we know that mental illness may have a genetic connection, meaning that if someone is diagnosed with a mental illness, others in their family are more likely to experience mental illness.  We also know that traumatic events, such as natural disasters, violence, bullying or extreme stress can play a role in triggering the onset of mental illness.  Certain viruses can contribute to mental illness, especially when they affect fetuses and young children.  Substance abuse, toxins in the environment, and brain injury are also known to cause mental illness.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Common Misconceptions of Mental Illness</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Among the greatest problems facing those who experience mental illness are the untrue beliefs that many people have about these brain disorders.   These untrue beliefs keep people from getting the help and support they need.  So, let's set the record straight.

The truth is:  mental illness is no one's fault.  Lack of information about the science of the brain led to mental illness being viewed as a problem of will power,  character, or even faith.

The truth is:  In most cases, people with mental illness who take their medication regularly and who do not abuse alcohol or other drugs are no more violent than people who do not have a mental illness.   The risk of violence increases when mental illness is left untreated.  And, as is true of everyone, with or without a mental illness, the risk of violence increases when someone is using illegal or street drugs such as crack, meth, cocaine, speed, and PCP.

The truth is: There is hope for people with serious mental illness.  People who get treatment for mental illness can lead full and productive lives.  Although it is sometimes difficult to find appropriate treatments and support, they do exist and ongoing research holds promise for new, more effective treatments with fewer side effects.

<Content id="0">If you think that someone may be thinking of harming him or herself, do not be afraid to raise the subject with them. If you ask someone whether they ever think of suicide and they say yes, you must take it seriously.  Do not be afraid to ask for specific information about their plans.  There is a list of questions in the Resource Area that you can ask to determine whether someone is suicidal.

Some signs a person may be suicidal are:

&#8226; Threatening to hurt or kill him or herself
&#8226; Looking for ways to kill him or herself, such as seeking access to pills, weapons, etc.
&#8226; Talking or writing about death, dying or suicide

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can we prepare for a crisis?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">If you are an individual with a mental illness, you can prepare for crisis situations by making a Psychiatric Advanced Directive  or P.A.D., and completing a Wellness Recovery Action Plan, or WRAP, to let friends, family and other caregivers know what your wishes are should you be hospitalized or incarcerated.

Family and other caregivers can prepare by having crisis numbers at their fingertips and educating themselves about crisis response to mental health situations. Programs such as NAMI Family-to-family and Mental Health First Aid can help you prepare for dealing with crisis situations. We have included contact information and tips for handling crisis situations in the Resource Area of this page.</Content>

<Content id="0">Recovery from mental illness is possible!   When we speak of recovery, we mean the ability to live a full and satisfying life with mental illness.  Recovery is a life long journey which is defined differently by each person.  Recovery means creating a life where mental illness is not the main focus, a life comprised of healthy relationships and interests, and the ability to become a part of society and to contribute to society through working, volunteering, or taking part in social activities.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What treatments are there for mental illness?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Numerous treatments and services for mental illness are available and the majority of people diagnosed with mental illness that receive treatment experience relief from their symptoms.

Effective treatment for mental illness should address all aspects of the illness, including the biological, psychological and social aspects.  This bio-psycho-social model of treatment provides comprehensive treatment including medication, psychotherapy, and social supports.

Biological treatments address the level of chemicals in the brain that regulate emotions and behavior and include medications and non-pharmaceutical treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy or ECT.  They can also include exercise, nutritional support and other holistic treatments.

Psychological treatments address factors that influence emotional and behavioral functioning including feelings and thought processes, goal setting, and self-awareness. These can include Interpersonal Therapy, or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

Social supports and treatments address environmental factors such as family and relationships, employment, housing and education, and peer support.

The choice and combination of treatment and services depends on the type of mental illness, the severity of symptoms, the availability of options and individual preference.   Most people with mental illness report that a combination of treatments, services and supports works best to support their recovery.

<Content id="0">After a mental health crisis, it is normal for there to be a recuperation period.   Mental illness crises have real and lasting effects on physical and emotional well-being.  Because of this, it is important that during this period of recuperation, people who have had a mental illness crisis need to rest and avoid stress.  It is sometimes difficult for family and friends to understand these needs because their loved one looks fine, but in truth, they are physically and mentally exhausted.  The best thing that caregivers can do during this period is to learn about the mental illness affecting their loved one, to support them in finding and getting treatment, and to listen to them as they find their way back to a new normal.</Content>

<Content id="0">The human body is a single organism comprised of many parts working together as one, with each part affecting and being affected by others. This means that while mental illnesses may involve chemical imbalances in the brain, the rest of the body can be affected as well. Mood and brain function are impacted by what we eat and drink, how much or how little exercise we get, the music we listen to and even the color of our walls! Sleep and mental health are closely related as well. Explore the links to the left to learn more about how mental and physical health are interrelated.</Content>

It takes vigilance, planning and a strong support system.  Many people use a Wellness Recovery Action Plan to help them stay in recovery.  Others refer to their Recovery Toolbox, an informal list of things that help keep them on track and instructions on how to find their way again should they encounter difficulties.

<Content id="0">An important part of recovery is building a social network and healthy relationships with family and others. However, people with mental illness and their families are often isolated due to the nature of some mental illnesses and also due to stigma.

Support groups for consumers and family members can be a source of support from people who are experiencing the same things.

Drop in centers organize social events and provide a place where consumers can go to interact with others.  For a list of Drop in centers in San Diego County, look in the Resource Area.</Content>

There are resources available to those who have a serious mental illness who have been unable to find adequate employment.

The County of San Diego's Case Management services assist consumers with enrolling in financial assistance programs, including those that provide representative payee services, emergency housing, utility payments, rent subsidies and drug rehabilitation expenses. The programs are accessed through Behavioral Health Services, Adult Protective Services, and HIV/AIDS County of San Diego Case Managers only. Referrals must be made through County of San Diego.

Government Social Security programs like SSI and SSDI, and food stamps are available to those who qualify. To learn about the financial support available in your state and community and how to apply for it, contact your local Social Security Administration  field office. There are links to agencies and sites in the Resource Area.

People coping with illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder often need help with the complicated process of applying for the money they're entitled to receive.</Content>

<Content id="0">In addition to your treatment plan, recovery may include activities that help you feel successful and productive. These activities may include hobbies, volunteer work or vocational training. Finding work in a setting that meets your personal needs can be an important part of helping you feel like a part of your community. Sometimes people need to learn new skills or relearn lost or forgotten skills. Practicing these skills in a supportive and safe place such as a drop-in center, advocacy center or Clubhouse program may be a good stepping-stone in recovery. In these places, you can work on social skills, practice working with others, follow a schedule and learn to work within your own limits and energy level. The best part of these activities is that you'll be working with others who understand what you are going through. For some people, a side effect of their illness is that they lose certain skills or cannot think as clearly or quickly as before. This  can lead to feelings of frustration or loss for those who can't easily return to their former work life. If this is the case for you, it's important to recognize those feelings. It won't happen overnight, but there are things you can do to help you prepare to return to work. Programs exist to help you find your strengths and help you successfully search for a job</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I help support my loved one with mental illness?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Individuals with mental illness describe three ways that family and other caregivers can best help them.

First, learn about the illness. Understanding the lived experience of our love ones with mental illness helps us to put their behaviors and struggles in perspective.

Second, help them get effective treatment and social supports.  Often individuals with mental illness do not have the energy or focus that is sometimes needed to navigate insurance companies, medical systems and social services We can help them by advocating for them and tracking down available resources. This can be especially challenging when we don't agree with our loved ones on what treatment is appropriate.  At times, our loved ones may not be able to act in their own best interest and there may even be times when your loved one's life depends on getting them treatment against their will.

And third, listen to their concerns and feelings with an open mind. Withhold judgment and advice, unless it is asked for, and give them the time and space to recuperate, and rebuild their life.

NAMI San Diego has a number of programs that can help you learn to support your loved one. Look in the Resource area for more information.</Content>

<Content id="0">The stigma around mental illness can isolate individuals and their families, eroding the social support systems that we come to depend upon to help us through other crises.

The Family-to-Family educational program and family support groups are great ways to build a supportive network of people who are experiencing the same struggles.

You can also call the NAMI San Diego Helpline or one of the important numbers on this page.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is mental illness or severe emotional disturbance in children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">While there has been discussion about whether our society is diagnosing normal childhood behavior as emotional or mental impairment, the facts speak for themselves.

In children, severe emotional disturbance is a term that describes disorders in children and adolescents that have difficulty functioning at home or in school or community settings.  These disorders are thought to be related to underlying conditions such as mental illnesses or environmental traumas such as physical or emotional abuse or neglect, out-of-home placement, brain injury, exposure to drugs and alcohol or to violence.

13% of youth aged 8-15 live with emotional disturbance severe enough to cause significant impairment in their day-to-day lives. This figure jumps to 21% in youth aged 13-18.

50% of all lifetime cases of severe emotional disturbance begin by age 14 and 75% by age 24.

Early detection and treatment of severe emotional disturbance is important.  Research into childhood emotional disturbances has shown that intensive early treatment may in some cases lessen the effects of the disorders and, in some cases, prevent serious mental illnesses from developing altogether.  Unfortunately, The average delay between onset of symptoms and intervention is 8-10 years. Only 50% of youth with diagnosable disorders receive treatment.

As a results, approximately 50% of students aged 14 and older with a severe emotional disturbance drop out of high school--the highest dropout rate of any disability group.

70% of youth in state and local juvenile justice systems have a diagnosable emotional or mental health impairment, with at least 20% experiencing severe symptoms.

Severe emotional disturbances that affect children and adolescents include but are not limited to anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorders, childhood-onset bipolar disorder, early onset depression, early onset schizophrenia, eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder or A.D.H.D.

<BaseQuestion id="0">Who should I talk to if I think my child or adolescent may have a mental illness?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">If you think your child may have an emotional or mental impairment talk to your child's primary care doctor about your concerns, and describe what you have seen.  If they confirm your feelings that there is a concern, then you can work toward getting your child the help they need.

As part of the diagnostic process a comprehensive physical examination should be done to rule out other physical conditions that may be causing a child's symptoms.  They should also be evaluated for substance use problems, learning disabilities, sensory integration problems, and other physical or mental disorders, that may cause behavioral problems or poor school performance.    You can also ask your child's school to do diagnostic testing to help with a diagnosis.

Once other causes for concerning behavior have been ruled out a mental health provider that specializes in childhood mental illness should be consulted. Your child's primary care physician may be able to refer you to a mental health professional.  You can also ask for referrals from families involved with NAMI San Diego or other advocacy organizations.  To find a child psychiatrist, visit the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry website.  The link is listed in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What can I do to support my child?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">You can support your child or adolescent by helping them find an accurate diagnosis and effective treatments.
Getting an accurate diagnosis takes time and can be a frustrating process for the individual and family.  During this process it is important to focus on finding effective interventions to address the individual's symptoms.

If emotional or mental illness interferes with a child's education, schools are required to provide special education and related services in the school setting.  Families and teachers should work together to find effective interventions, accommodations, and supports that promote positive behaviors, academic achievement, and prevent challenging behaviors in school.  NAMI's Parents and Teachers as Allies program promotes mutual understanding and communication between families and school professionals.

For some children, having a diagnosis is scary and they may be resistant to accept it.  Others are relieved to know that what is happening to them is caused by an illness, that they are not alone, and that there are treatment options that can make them feel and do better.

 It is important to find ways to use the strengths and interests of your child to help him or her cope with difficult symptoms. Activities like exercise, martial arts, music, and art can be extremely beneficial.   Ask your child's mental health professional to recommend effective interventions, skills training, support groups, and other options that can help your child cope with symptoms and develop the skills necessary to ultimately lead a full and productive life.

You can also support your child by educating yourself about mental illness.  The NAMI Basics education class empowers parents and caregivers to be affective advocates for their children.

<BaseQuestion id="0">Is medication use safe for children and adolescents?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There has been much concern about the use of psychotropic medications or medications to treat mental illness.  Little research has been done about the long term effects of these medications.

Psychotropic medications for young children should be used only when anticipated benefits outweigh risks. Parents should be fully informed and decisions made only after carefully weighing these factors. Children and adolescents must be closely monitored and frequently evaluated as the side effects common to some medications can be particularly difficult for children. At the same time, psychotropic medications can be lifesaving.

Medications are only part of a treatment plan which affects the biological causes of mental illness.  Even with medication mental illness can continue to affect an individual's life so it is important to address the psychological and social aspects of mental illness as well.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the relationship between physical and mental illnesses in older adults?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Many of the physical illnesses common in older adults co-occur with mental illnesses like anxiety and depression.  Some of the symptoms of these common illnesses can also mimic those of mental illness or dementia.  Likewise, the side effects of medications commonly taken by older adults can have side effects that mimic those of mental illness, especially in the case of drug interactions or overdose.

Heart or lung disease can affect behavior when there is not enough oxygen getting to the brain.  Diseases of the glands, such as the thyroid, adrenal, pituitary or pancreas can cause problems regulating emotion, perception, memory and thinking.

Poor nutrition can also contribute to symptoms of mental illness in older adults.  If the body is not getting adequate nutrition, it can affect behaviors.  Too little sugar in the bloodstream can cause confusion and personality changes, while conditions like pernicious anemia, caused by problems absorbing vitamin B12, can cause irritability, depression and dementia.

Physical issues related to aging, such as dental problems can contribute to poor nutrition, and lack of exercise due to limited mobility can cause depressed mood and irritability.</Content>

<Content id="0">You may be surprised to learn that suicide rates among adults 65 and older are higher than the rate for the national population. The group with the highest suicide rate is white males 85 and older.

While the many life changes that come with aging can cause anyone to feel down or out of sorts, some people are not able to recover from these feelings like they might have at other times in their lives.</Content>

<Content id="0">Treatment for mental illness in older adults is consistent with treatment for other age groups.  Medications can be effective and it is important to tell all healthcare providers about all medications and supplements to avoid drug interactions.  Side effects should be closely monitored as well.

Psychotherapy is effective as well, and a combination of medication and therapy has been shown to be very effective in reducing the recurrence of depression in older adults.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I support older adults?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are many things loved ones can do to support older adults who either have a risk of developing or are currently living with mental illness.

Loss of a loved one, loss of independence, isolation, lasting complications or pain stemming from medical conditions, economic lifestyle changes, the stress of caring for a disabled spouse, the lack of the robustness of youth, or a combination of these and other factors increase the risk of mental illness and suicide in older adults.

Inform your loved one's caregivers of any changes in behavior or mood that you see and make sure physical causes for these changes are ruled out by medical professionals.

Pay close attention to mood and provide extra support during transitions, such as changes in housing arrangements, new illness diagnoses or treatment, or changes in mobility and independence. Also, make sure that healthcare professionals are asking about suicidal ideation and monitoring mental health during these periods as well.

Take steps to ensure the senior in your life is not left bereft and feeling alone. Visit often. Interact by playing games, dining together, or simply talking. Frequent visits help determine if seniors are doing well. Interacting provides the opportunity to look for and gauge the signs listed above in an unobtrusive way. If you can't visit yourself, look into volunteer or paid services where your loved one lives to find a companion who can visit them. Some facilities have programs to keep older adults active and engaged, and there are community programs that they can take part in as well if they are living on their own.

Also you can help your older loved one stay safe from phone and internet scams by educating them on how to protect their privacy.

Look in the Resource Area for more information on supporting older adults and for a list of programs for older adults in San Diego County.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is stigma?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Stigma is viewing someone in a negative way because they have an illness or condition.  For people with mental illness and their families stigma is everywhere--it can even come from ourselves.

Stigma is when our loved ones with mental illness are excluded from social activities, job opportunities, and education.  It is in the media where people with mental illness are portrayed as violent criminals.  It is in the social services system that is ill-equipped to meet the needs of people with mental illness.

And stigma is when people with mental illness don't want to get treatment or take medication because they believe these negative views themselves.  Or, when family members blame themselves for a loved one's mental illness.

There is much you can do to help fight stigma.  For more information look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is recovery language?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Language is important.  How we speak about mental illness can dispel stigma and stereotypes or reinforce them.  Recovery language is person focused, putting the emphasis on the person and their strengths rather than their illness.  For instance, we use the phrase "individuals with mental illness" rather than mentally ill individuals.  We talk about a person having schizophrenia rather than a "schizophrenic person."   When talking about symptoms we talk about what the person is experiencing, so rather than saying that someone is delusional, we say they are having delusions.  For a guide to using recovery focused language, look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<Content id="0">The National Alliance on Mental Illness in San Diego is the city's voice on mental illness. We are part of the grass-roots, non-profit, national NAMI organization founded in 1979 by family members of people with mental illness. We are also an affiliate of NAMI California.

We have a threefold mission:

To support people with mental illnesses and their families by helping them find coping mechanisms for their daily struggle with brain disorders.

To educate people who have mental illness, their families, and the general public about mental illness with the goal of dispelling ignorance and stigma.

And, to advocate for more research and an improved system of mental health services across the nation.

At the heart of NAMI San Diego's mission is the sharing of information and striving to end the stigma associated with mental illness. To this end, we offer a Helpline, support groups, educational meetings, newsletters, a lending library and a number of classes on mental illness held at various locations throughout San Diego County.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Theyíre just as capable of working as anyone else</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">People who have a mental health diagnosis are absolutely capable of working.  They can work in any field that they choose to enter and they can work at any level that they choose to engage in.  We have found in the work that we do in training peers to become peer supports that everything from part-time all the way up to permanent director positions are the kind of work that peers are capable of doing.  But that work goes beyond the just the behavioral health field peers and work in any kind of environment whether itís academic or more oriented toward the corporate field.  I know people personally who have advanced degrees and work in high-level scientific positions doing all kinds of amazing research, and for them part of having a mental health diagnosis includes being able to show everyone that theyíre just as capable of working as anyone else and often times are even more willing to work harder because they feel like they have so many more people to encourage with the work that they do in spreading that hope just by the simple fact of being employed.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">It makes it that much more easy to focus on our wellness rather than getting stuck in the symptoms.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">WRAP stands for the wellness recovery action plan. WRAP was developed by Mary and Ellen Copeland and itís designed to be a recovery in wellness plan for individuals who have a mental health diagnosis or are supporting someone with a mental health diagnosis or who are living human beings. Frankly, WRAP is good for anybody. The idea behind it being that we as individuals are the ones who are most capable of deciding what we need in our recovery.  So the WRAP helps us to put together a plan of action, just like it says in the name, for when were faced with those times the give us challenges. Whether those challenges come from symptoms or life circumstances, whether itís triggers or early warning signs, either way weíre going to be prepared for whatís coming up if we have that plan already in place. And, for those of us that have a mental health diagnosis it makes it that much more easy to focus on our wellness rather than getting stuck in the symptoms themselves.  Because that way, symptoms or triggers or challenges are just something that we experience and we have a plan for it so we donít have to be worried or scared if I find that Iím facing a particular trigger or Iím having a certain symptom. Then I already have a tool that I know that I can use and all of a sudden that symptom is just an everyday kind of thing that I can take care of and I donít have to worry about. Itís not derailing my wellness or the success that I put together in my life.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">There was a lot of shame that came with feeling like I needed help from anybody</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">For me personally, when it came to earlier points in my own recovery journey where I would have people share with me that there were professionals that could provide me with assistance or there were tools out there that I could be making use of, one of the biggest barriers for me wasnít that those tools were there or that they were suggested to me, but that there was a lot of shame that came with feeling like I needed help from anybody, anyone professional or otherwise.  One of the most encouraging things for me happened in terms of my family in terms of providing support, offering to go with me, to participate in these wellness tools so that it wasnít about me being broken and needing help that I didnít want to participate in, it was simply an offer that was out there if I ever change my mind.  If I ever decided that I wanted to participate in help of any kind it suddenly became an option for me to not have to go alone and to not feel like I was broken.  It was something we were going to do together and that meant that it was something that I could share with someone else both when I was excited and when I was discouraged.</Content>

<Content id="0">Stigma is something that everyone faces, whether we realize it or not.  For those of us who are people of color it is something that we may run into on a daily basis that comes in terms of people judging us on our appearance before the even meet us.  For those of us who are part of the LGBTQIA community it may be something that we run into when we see the advertisements donít include our loved ones are our family structure.  For those of us who have a mental health diagnosis frequently it comes in the form of people not believing that our recovery is possible, or by their limiting our possibilities before we even get started. I know that as a person who identifies with all three of those groups there are days when I feel incredibly discouraged,  because I feel like no oneís really paying attention to who I am, they are only looking at the labels that I wear.  Then I remember that those are labels people put on me and I donít have to choose to keep those labels.  And, a lot of hope comes from having people around me who are going to look beyond the label.  Theyíre going to recognize that I have talents and abilities and theyíre going to acknowledge that sure, maybe I have stuff, but everybody has got stuff and everybody, just as much as they have stuff, has the possibility to achieve amazing things.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">The words that we use frame the thoughts that we have.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">What is recovery language?  Recovery language is the language that we hope that everyone will use one day because recovery language is about more than just mental health.  Recovery language is about creating an environment that allows all of us to be fully recognized as people.  When we talk about recovery language frequently what comes up is that itís language that puts the human and the person before the diagnosis or the label of any kind.  Often times when we see people referring to politically correct language theyíre talking about something thatís being forced upon them.  The reality about recovery language is that itís something that we can all choose to use. One of the things that I frequently tell people when Iím discussing recovery language with them is to think about it this way if I choose to use a particular word derogatory or demeaning, regardless of my intention, in using that word itís going to start to frame the way I think about the people or the things to whom I ascribe that word.  But, if I make the conscious choice to not use that language, slowly itís going to alter the way that I think about things because the words that we use frame the thoughts that we have.  And our thoughts and our thinking thatís what creates the way that we act.  And how we act, thatís how we are in the world.  Thatís the world that we create around ourselves.  So when we choose to use recovery language, person centered, hope filled, non-stigmatizing, were changing our own way of thinking and hopefully, bit by bit, changing the world that surrounds us.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">For me personally, sleep is an early warning sign.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">To start off with, I would say that for me sleep is very important to my recovery. I know that sleep can be something that has a profound effect on how people react to both the medications and their other wellness tools.  For me personally, sleep is an early warning sign. When I noticed that my sleep is starting to become impacted whether by too much sleep or feeling like the sleep that I am getting is restful, that to me is a signifier, even before anything else starts to go, that maybe I should check into whatís going on.  Itís a moment for me to take a look at my list of daily maintenance items and see if thereís anything that that Iíve been leaving off, however accidentally, that might be having an impact on my sleep.  Itís also a way of me being able to put the brakes on any kind of symptoms that might get in the way later on so that once I got that sleep thing under control I can evaluate where I am and kind of take a look at what whatís happening and know that, hey I got a good night sleep I can pretty much take on anything.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">I usually came in with a list of questions already prepared.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">For me, one of the things that I learned in trying to get an accurate diagnosis was that I asked a lot of questions.  Every time I went to my doctor I said, well what about this, and sometimes I feel this way, what does that mean?  The other thing that I did was that I was willing to see more than one doctor.  Sometimes thatís what it takes.  The first diagnosis that I got when I was much younger didnít really seem applicable and it didnít really seem to match what I was actually feeling, so I stopped going to the doctor. Years later as an adult, I went back and this time I was more equipped. I usually came in with a list of questions already prepared and then I went home and I did my research.  I also had people who I really trusted, who I cared about, who I could sit down with and say this is what theyíre thinking my diagnosis might be, what you guys think? And, that allowed me to have a sort of sounding board for when I wasnít sure because sometimes I did that reality check even in terms of something like my diagnosis just being sure that I felt comfortable with having that as something that was going to go on my medical record.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">You want to be aware of where theyíre going, with what they're doing online.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">I would say that for a child to use the Internet, if even if they have a mental health diagnosis, the rules that you can put to it are good to be more or less the same rules that you put toward any young person using the Internet. You want to be aware of where theyíre going, with what they're doing online.  You also want to make sure that they understand that itís not just imaginary people on the other side of those screenings, thereís real people out there who are attached to them. And, just like they would say something if someone were mean to them in person, bullying them, they have every right to express that same level of distress or discomfort with anything that they see or experience online.  So much of this begins even before the kid picks up a computer.  Itís going to begin at home talking about and having an open dialogue that way people can feel like theyíre enabled and equipped to be able to answer questions and to ask questions about the things that they find online. Because just as much is there going to be stigmatizing things on the Internet every day, only open the newspaper will meet or watch TV we see or hear non-recovery attitudes and non-recovery language.  If thatís what weíre afraid of that we're going to run into online, we start the conversation before we've even opened the computer.</Content>

Itís two hours each session and it is for any individual 18 years and older that identifies as having direct lived experience with mental illness. Itís a free course and the courses are sequential and they build on the ones and before them. Itís a combination of group interactive exercises, lecture material and also independent exercises.  And, really I always tell individuals that itís another tool to add to the recovery tool bag. Itís in a setting where everyone in the room identifies as having that direct lived experience with mental illness and it really adds to the cohesion and the camaraderie of the group, because everyone can relate to one another. Itís also a great tool just education wise. It teaches a lot of educational topics and subjects all relating back to mental health.  And, at the end of the course individuals have the opportunity to take all the material thatís been presented to them well into their wellness journal beyond the course.</Content>

<Content id="0">The NAMI San Diego Connections support group is a support group here that we hold within the NAMI San Diego affiliate. Itís an hour and a half support group that we offer, we actually offer about five within the San Diego County, four in English and one in Spanish.  And itís a support group where any individual 18 years or older that lives with direct mental illness can go and attend, to find an environment that is healthy, free of judgment and definitely confidential.  I think within recovery it is pivotal to oneís wellness and recovery to have connections and build bonds.  It definitely allows for the individual to not feel alone and withdraw, it definitely adds value to their own experience and their journey and actually gives it a voice, a purpose.  And within a group setting you not only find that you can relate to other people, but that your story is worth something to others and that you have the influence to positively affect others that are walking that same journey with you.  So, you not only impact other people but in return you also help yourself.  It helps you to not feel alone, to not withdraw and then it gives you also that boost of confidence to go out there and give, give life another shot and  boosts definitely self-esteem and wellness.</Content>

<Content id="0">I have participated in the NAMI Connections and the NAMI Peer-to-Peer programs here within our affiliate. I have taken the Peer-to-Peer class in the past as a participant and then I have also attended the support groups as a participant.  And now, four years into working with NAMI, I now facilitate the support groups that we offer as a facilitator. And, I also sometimes co-mentor the Peer-to-Peer classes as one of the individuals that teaches the class.  And, itís definitely been transformative just being involved with both programs.  I think every single time I either facilitate or I teach a course, you really see growth within the participants.  You see individuals learn from their experiences and maybe for the first time they actually feel like their story has a purpose that they can still hope and help other people.  And in return it also helps me understand that weíre all in this together, that we are really never alone and that a lot of great things can happen from presumably tragic events as mental illness can be.</Content>

<Content id="0">I know with me sometimes when my anxiety gets really heightened being in the moment is one of the last things on my mind one of the hardest things for me to actually do. And, it really allows, and gives me actually the permission to be in the present moment and to not think of the future or to blame myself for things in the past or to go back and rewind things in the past. Itís allowed me that permission to focus, in my case I do a lot of breathing exercises and, in my case, to focus on my breathing and to allow that to be the focal point and to allow everything else to wash away and for it to be okay. Mindfulness has improved my life because it again it has given me the ability to calm myself, to not jump to conclusions, and, I know, with my anxiety can be very white or black thinking, there is no gray, and I think with mindfulness and my ability to calm down, it allows me to put things into perspective to not jump to conclusions and to really look at things from a calmer point of view.</Content>

<Content id="0">I have been working with NAMI San Diego for over four years and I know for a fact that NAMI San Diego has kept me in my recovery. I was diagnosed with anxiety and major depressive disorder in the spring of 2007 and I can honestly say that I have been one of the individuals that has benefited from having an amazing support system around them. I had an amazing group of friends, the medication worked, I had an amazing therapist and psychiatrist.  And, I think the combination of that support group is really what got me jumpstarted again into my wellness journey.  And thatís what NAMI San Diego is here for, thatís what we do.  We are here offering that support system that individuals may be looking for in order to jumpstart their wellness journey. I see the growth in the Peer-to-Peer classes from individuals that graduate. I see the light bulb moments go off. I see the education that they walk away with and that gives them a boost of confidence that gives them the energy to kind of give it another shot.  So I know that NAMI San Diego works. I know that the work that weíre doing is positively affecting and impacting everyone that comes in contact with any of our programs. So Iím really thankful to be a part of such an amazing organization.  We debunk stigma every day.  Iím just really excited to be here.</Content>

San Diego County Health and Human Services really provides or allows for multiple different specific types of programming in the county, anywhere from young people who might be suffering from psychosis related to schizophrenia all the way to possible human trafficking to young people who are really struggling to support themselves and their daily lives as young adults.  And, each program has a support system in place for parents or families related to the young person.  Parents themselves can look to their community, they can also look to their own friends and families to find some support. You are not alone, thereís definitely young people who are struggling and parents or caregivers that are attached to them that are concerned and often afraid and not sure what to do. So looking at your community to get some support locally, we have NAMI as a great resource along with others if you do your research and sort of look into what the community has to offer.</Content>

<Content id="0">These days with our young people, and I primarily work with kids, I have from 10 all the way up to 25, so itís quite the array, and depending on their age and the development stage in life they can be exhibiting some very normal kind of, yet concerning behaviors.  You know itís quite typical for young people in high school to sort of try out new things, sort of test their boundaries as human beings, think that there think that they are invincible and try things and, you know, that maybe their peer groups will support that and direct that.  Itís really important to know your kid.  I mean, parents and caregivers, ultimately know your child. You know who you raised and if you start seeing things that are a little odd, a little off, a little out of the normal, out of the usual, thatís something that you should pay attention to. I do caution you from googling any symptoms that you might find as the Internet can give you too much information at times and itís best to speak to professional.  A local program in San Diego does a great job of screening for early signs of mental illness. The program is with Providence Community Services. Itís called Kickstart program.  And sometimes thereís, what it does is it assesses for early signs of psychosis as it relates to major mental illnesses like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder with psychotic episodes.  In a screening that they do they can rule in or rule out other mental illnesses as they see as the test tells them. So itís important to definitely speak to a professional, find out more information as you can and donít be afraid to talk about it. I think itís really important that you yourself as a parent or caregiver donít isolate or donít try to keep it inside. Youíll know, trust your instincts in regard to whatís going on with your children.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">If you can catch it soon the chances of recovery are higher.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Research has shown that identifying early signs of mental illness, potential mental illness. And again, it is a potential, it doesnít always mean that itís going to happen, but it, definitely if there are some signs indicating that there are, that there is something going on, itís so important to catch it early.  The earlier you catch it the more likely you will be able to do what it needs to be done in order to prevent that mental illness from becoming more devastating, more challenging, decreasing their level of functioning, your ability to support them, their ability to get help. So the earlier that you can get involved the better.  What tends to happen particularly with young people ages 10 to 25, is parents, caregivers, friends will see signs but wonít say anything.  Theyíll think that they are just all, thatís just a phase of their life, oh thatís just something Johnny or Sally is doing and itíll pass, and sometimes that is what the indicator is that there might be something going on that needs to get checked out.  The earlier you catch it, just like cancer or diabetes or any other pager illness thatís preventable, if you can catch it soon the chances of recovery are higher.  And so itís important to do so and not to ignore any of the signs.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Thereís tons of hope for young people if these things are caught early</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">First of all, really some of the signs can occur as early as 10 years old for some young people.  Itís important to be educated.  One of the biggest indicators for young people who may have exposure or may have the ability may have the possibility of exhibiting or developing a mental illness is family history, so if you yourself, a caregiver or someone who is related to the young person has had a history of mental illness, itís important.  Thatís a warning sign. First what we see in these young people is a pretty dramatic change in behavior. But, first and foremost, itís interesting, these young people tend to be incredibly smart. Theyíre above average in their creativity, their intellect, they really stand out in a crowd. We find more often than not these young people just seem to be above average in their level of functioning, and what tends to happen is all of a sudden things start changing for them.  Whatís happening to the young person is, their mind starts to play tricks on them.  They might see shadows.  They might see images. They might see colors and lights.  They might start hearing murmuring or ticking sounds or any other range of noises that are starting to come from outside of their head.  They might start believing delusional thoughts about themselves, usually it tends to be more of the paranoid nature. And, they think that someoneís out to get them, they think that someoneís out to harm them.  And, you know, upon kind of checking this out with them thereís no reason for them to be afraid of anybody.  So those signs will start to occur relatively slowly but youíll see them start, sort of become more and more severe in the sense that thereís a disconnect with reality around it.  At one point they will have, see those shadows, hear those voices, or those, hear the sound and know theyíre not real. Theyíll know that somethingís going on with their mind at some point, and typically it looks like a psychotic episode, they will switch over to where those things that they see and the things that they hear they will not be able to distinguish them from reality.  And that is so important to catch the young people while theyíre experiencing these prodromal or premorbid symptoms in order to sort of educate them.   Let them know, stress is a huge factor in this.   What the programs locally will help families of young people do is reduce stress because not knowing whatís going on with you, if youíre the child is very very detrimental.  They are scared to death that someoneís going to find out that something is going wrong with them, and that theyíre ìcrazy.î And, unfortunately with the stigma that we have in our communities, they are there just forced to not talk to anyone anybody about it.  So itís important for us to educate to give the information out, reduce the stress so that those signs donít get any worse.  And, thereís tons of hope for young people if these things are caught early.  Now unfortunately you have many young people in our community that have not had the opportunity to get those signs, to be seen early, and they are experiencing significant mental illness like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder with psychotic episodes, and those young people have very have a very difficult time navigating the day-to-day life, you know, requirements; that is keeping, you know, a job or staying in school, being able to really have meaningful interpersonal relationships.  So, because of all that, the mental illness that they have tends to get in the way of them getting treatment and getting help.  And, so we really hope to prevent them from ever getting to that place.  But we have had a lot of success in supporting those young people as well.  There is a program locally thatís called Catalyst program that works with young people 16 to 24 who have been diagnosed with said disorders, like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with psychotic episodes have a history of alcohol and drug use, typically because they want to self-medicate or they have no other outs or no other options.   They tend to be homeless, a history of having not succeeded in our traditional standards of care.  So, catalyst really supports them in all areas of their life to be able to give them a fighting chance and some hope to be able to live to live a very fulfilling life.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What matters is that youíre able to provide a nonjudgmental, nonbiased conversation.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Families get stuck in the way of communicating and their way of being. And, you know, thereís nothing wrong with that, and they often take the lead from their parents. And, people, families are transmitted in the ways they communicate from generation to generation.  And, it could be that they families or parents donít even know that they are not open to talking about things or that theyíre preventing their child from feeling comfortable or anything along those lines. I mean, what the best way to do is, especially as a parent or caregiver, is just to be really open to different styles of parenting, different ways of communicating.  You know, a lot of times parents are just, theyíre just so afraid of doing something wrong or saying something wrong, that maybe it was their fault that things happened, you just sort of have to wipe all of that away.  This needs the direction and the attention of a parent or caregiver and none of that matters.  What matters is that youíre able to provide a nonjudgmental, nonbiased conversation with your young person about the ways of the world and how things happen.  And, if you have a history of mental illness or your family has a history of mental illness, and you probably havenít talked about a much growing up, itís time to sort of open up the stores of communication and just speak about it. What was it like for you as a parent, or child of a parent who had mental illness, or did you have a friend that you know was really ill and you saw them deteriorate, what was that like.  And, just opening up the doors and speaking about mental health and how it affects us, and being as nonjudgmental and unbiased as possible.  It is an absolute piece of our culture, of us being human.  Itís unavoidable.  I mean thereís, itís everywhere and itís so important for us to have that topic on the table, to speak about openly and honestly and without judgment or ridicule.  And I have the hope that people are doing that more and more these days.  So Iíll continue to keep the discussion alive and so should you.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">It sort of takes the power out of it if you can have a communication.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Suicide can be a very uncomfortable conversation to have with anyone. I think it, personally I think it sort of taps into our mortality and who we are as humans.  And typically we all want to have a zest for life and be passionate about it but unfortunately some of us donít have that. We hear about it, you know, with our public figures and celebrities that take their own life and so it something that young kids will be exposed to. And itís important to have a conversation around it, again with just sort of being unbiased on judgmental, being very.  I think for parents itís a challenge because they donít want to, like, put that thought in their childís mind, but trust me, that thoughts already in your childís mind if theyíve heard about it at the school yard, or read about it on the Internet or on social media or even on TV.  So itís there, itís out there. I donít think, I definitely donít believe that talking about suicide is going to cause anyone to want to kill themselves or take their own lives.  Itís just the opposite. It sort of takes the power out of it if you can have a communication, if you can communicate about it you can, as a parent or caregiver communicate your own concerns about suicide. Speak honestly about what you feel about suicide and about how, maybe suicideís affected you in your life, if at all.  And, really, lay down the foundation to have those communications with your kid if youíre concerned about them one day having those signs or even just to know about suicide in general.</Content>

<Content id="0">Now if youíre concerned that your child is suicidal or has some, youíre noticing behaviors like they are spending more time in the room than usual, their sleep patterns are disrupted, they tend to have hopelessness and worthlessness, maybe a tinge in their the communication with you -- the way they talk about themselves, they talk about others, maybe theyíre giving away some of their items they used to cherish, theyíre losing interest in things that used to be interested in, they donít want to get up and go to soccer practice anymore, or they donít want to get up and go to school anymore, you can be involved in be paying attention to how theyíre doing at school, are they being bullied, are they being cyber bullied.  If itís a young person whoís questioning their sexuality or their gender identity, those are young people who really are at risk because they feel so hopeless and helpless about their status in life, and who they are, and all young people are sort of investigating that, but particularly the young ones who are investigating and sort of questioning their sexuality and gender identity.  So be paying attention, keep that open dialogue. Try your best, as uncomfortable as it is and as afraid as you may be, to bring up the topic.  And, I think itís important to mention to as a parent, donít isolate yourself. You yourself need to be talking to others about it whether itís your significant, other family members, community members, someone that you trust.  Donít hide that within you because thatís just going to create more stress for your family.</Content>

They want to keep things to themselves and have ownership over them.  Itís very important as a parent or caregiver to really pay attention to whatís going on be connected with the school, be connected with who their friends are, and the parents of those friends. You know, do a little bit of your own research on the Internet with social media, and what Twitter is, and what all these other ones are.  Itís really important to know what is out there and how they might be confronted by challenges or threats or any issues.  And, take their issues really seriously.   Now parents donít always think, you know, if so-and-so didnít call them back but that itís a big deal, but for the young person it might be a big deal.  And so just being very empathetic and understanding about where theyíre at and how their feelings are.  But definitely, know your kid and know whatís going on with them.</Content>

We assist them with setting up any services such as getting, helping them get signed up for Medi-Cal, SSI, or SSDI.  And we can assist them with getting connected with the clinic to continue with their medication needs. And we also just offer general support as peers and as family members.  We also do, since we do have family specialists we will support the families.  The fact that now we, the Next Steps program now also does have alcohol and drug counselors, we now are able to support those that are facing substance abuse challenges, assisting them with residential treatment, twelve-step programs and things of that nature.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">When those two stigmas meet itís a perfect storm.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">What I have seen in the local community, as well as the broader LGBTQI community is thereís a lot of abandonment, thereís a lot of people who are questioning their personal worth.  Thereís a lot of people who are afraid of seeking any kind of community or support.  And for those individuals who may be struggling with depression that may have anxiety that may be questioning their own orientation or their gender identity.  Going to seek assistance and help is not the first thing that comes to mind.  Maybe turning to a friend, maybe getting information that is not appropriate.  Maybe not getting the kind of support because thereís a lot of fear.  So the stigma that surrounds mental illness, and the stigma that surrounds being Lesbian, gay, transsexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, is very predominant.  So when those two stigmas meet itís a perfect storm of not being able to form a community and really seek assistance</Content>

<Content id="0">So Iíve watched young adults, Iíve watched teenagers, Iíve watched grandparents, struggle with their coming out issues, whether that is as a gay man, as a lesbian woman, as a bisexual individual, whether or not gender identity is being questioned. And itís difficult.  Itís difficult to give them the support without knowing whatís available.  So in San Diego, there are resources available, both for sexual identity, for sexual orientation, both for mental illness as well, and of course NAMI San Diego is the go-to place for anything where support is needed for individuals or their families, through our helpline as well as many programs that San Diego NAMI runs. And then the center, the center which is a go to place in the center of San Diego in the Hillcrest area, for people who are struggling with coming out issues, for family members, PFLAG is another really important one.  Thatís parents and friends, parents family and friends of lesbian and gays, and transgender and bisexual.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">[It gets a] conversation going with these young adults who may never have had a forum like this before.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">NAMI San Diego has an amazing program, Ending the Silence, that is for role models, young adults living with a diagnosis, who are able to go in to high schools and middle schools around San Diego County and share their story with them.  They also share a video, and what this is able to do is, get a conversation going with these young adults who may never have had a forum like this before to talk about what mental illness looks like, what warning signs might look like.  How to ask for help and how to get help for a friend if theyíre concerned.  And the reality is that one in five of our youth are dealing with a mental illness and those often go undiagnosed for five to ten years.  So if the conversation can start sooner, and the stigma can be taken out of the conversation these young kids can get help so much faster.  And that means that they wonít be missing a beat and theyíll be able to get their life on track without the suffering that comes from five to ten years of misdiagnosis or lack of diagnosis.</Content>

<Content id="0">One of the most amazing things about the ending the silence program is the way that it makes middle schoolers and high schoolers feel safe talking about a topic that they donít normally feel safe talking about.  When they see someone in their early twenties owning their diagnosis, and living well in recovery with a smile on their face, talking in front of a group, they often feel comfortable sharing their own story and feeling like their peers might actually be more compassionate than they were expecting if they were to reach out for help.  And thatís an amazing thing to see.   To see kids being courageous with their own story and having that role model for them. We get amazing positive feedback all the time about how the program has helped these kids feel safe feel comfortable and have a little more hope that they can get help that their peers will be supportive for them if they do reach out.</Content>

<Content id="0">Lauraís law is court ordered treatment for individuals who refuse outpatient treatment or to seek services out in the community. The law in San Diego has been approved to be implemented and we are in the midst of developing those services.  What Lauraís law is has very specific nine criteria and these nine criteria must all be met to ensure that the individual that is being referred for assisted outpatient treatment meets all the eligibility requirements.  Some of the criteria for the individual with serious mental illness, it includes that the person has not been treated in the recent past it includes that the person has been hospitalized in the last 36 months psychiatrically, or they have been receiving treatment while in jail.  It includes episodes of violent behavior or aggression in the last 48 months.  Those are some of the current criteria there are nine as I said before.  Lauraís law does not order you to take medication or force you to take medication.  Certainly the judge that orders assisted outpatient treatment can recommend that the person to take medication through outpatient treatment but again that is voluntary choice.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">I think itís about choice.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">What is different is implementing assisted outpatient treatment in San Diego, is it gives the individual the choice of accepting the court order or it gives the individual the choice to voluntarily accept the similar services without the court order. Whatís different in San Diego is that we are utilizing the in-home outreach team or I-HOT team to initially outreach and engage persons who are resistant to treatment and in that way give the client or the consumer the opportunity to choose to participate before the individual is court ordered for treatment. And so the outreach teams, the I-HOT teams, would work very closely with the individual consumer to engage that individual on their own volition, by their own choice and if not if the client does not choose to engage then and the individual meets the nine criteria for assisted outpatient treatment under Lauraís law than they can proceed with the examination  So I think itís about choice, giving the client the services that they may need, the outreach  and engagement, and if that doesnít work then certainly apply Lauraís law in this case.</Content>

<Content id="0">So the In-Home Outreach Team or the I-HOT team is a program that was established and originated about four years ago as the result of the community and the stakeholders wanting to implement Lauraís law in San Diego and at that point the behavioral health services executive team.  We did research, we did our due diligence as to what services would be best to engage individuals and outreach to services. We came up with the IHOT or the In-Home Outreach Team which is really an outreach engagement, short term case management program which really worked with the individual and the family to enlist the participation of the person who is determined to have a mental illness. So we work very closely to engage them in services and refer them and link them to the appropriate services in the community, whether itís health programs or housing or substance use disorder programs or any other needs that the individual has. And so the I-HOT team is the screening program for Lauraís law potential participants.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">They donít want to be thought of as inadequate or incompetent.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are multiple reasons why persons or individuals do not seek mental health treatment of think a lot of it has to do with stigma.  A lot of it has to do with the fact that they are there are myths around what mental illness is and what serious mental illness is and they donít want to be thought of as you know inadequate or incompetent or the more negative terminology as crazy or losing their mind.  So I think that is a major part of it that really influences peopleís behaviors and seeking services.  The denial, the denial really protects the individual from having to admit or to see that there is something different about them there something wrong with themselves. There is a lack of insight into their mental health condition.at some level at other levels you know and this is why outreach and engagement works because the I-HOT team works with these individuals in such a way that is not about their mental illness but is about their mental health and how productive they can be and how they can contribute and what are their goals and what are their strengths rather than focusing on the negatives side effects of what a mental health or mental illness is, and trying to ameliorate that fear and that stigma associated with there something wrong with me.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Clubhouses are fabulous because theyíre run by peers.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A clubhouse is a psychosocial rehabilitation facility, and psychosocial means that it takes the social aspects and psychological aspects of life and combines it. So clubhouses have a work order day and they have classes throughout the day on a variety of topics.  The first clubhouse was created in the 40s in New York and was known as the Fountain House clubhouse, and it was basically a group of people who had been discharged from the New York psych hospital and they decided they wanted to support one another afterwards. And so they came together and met on a regular basis. And that is the first clubhouse and now itís an international model.  The memberships for clubhouses very depending on the clubhouse but the number one prerequisite for being a member of the clubhouse is to have a mental illness.  Some clubhouses require a letter from your doctor saying that yes you do have a mental illness and other clubhouses donít. It really depends on the clubhouse that youíre going with.  If youíre looking for a clubhouse is all you need to do is go to 211.org and at 211.org you can just search for a clubhouse, or you can call 211 and ask for a clubhouses.  I went to clubhouses originally because I was looking for a class on how to draw and then I found another class on writing.  Iíve also gone to clubhouses to learn about computers, and you can go to a clubhouse to get your food handlerís permit. Thereís just a variety of options and a variety of classes. Each clubhouse has its own unique culture, and the clubhouses are fabulous because theyíre run by peers, people like you and me who are looking for opportunities to improve themselves and move forward in recovery.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Recovery language is more than being politically correct.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Recovery language is person first language which is grounded in recovery. Recovery encompasses five principles which are hope, choice and accountability, empowerment, and finding a new purpose in life.  And often people find that through spirituality  So when I talk of  recovery language, for example instead of calling myself a schizophrenic I call myself a person living with schizophrenia.  Another important example is just when youíre trying to communicate in recovery language you want to make sure that all of your all of the words that you use create hope in someone else. A lot of people use slang that has to do with mental illness and some of it can be really derogatory I think oftentimes people donít recognize how much words can affect other people and for that reason itís important that we watch our own words, words like psycho crazy schizo Iíve been called the entire gambit and so when those words come up in conversation like, oh you got crazy mad skills itís kind of like pouring a little bit of hurt back into an open wound, because Iíve always been called those names when I was at my worst. When people use those words to refer to me it doesnít really encourage other people to learn more or to get to know me and so for that reason I think itís important that we are always looking to talk to people about people and not talk to illnesses about illnesses.  Describing me you could say you could say Iím an author, San Diegan or I feel down.  If you just blame it on my illness it doesnít do anything to solve the problem.  Saying "Sarah is schizophrenic," that just dehumanizes me. When I talk to people about not using the record the words like crazy and schizo psycho and they think, "oh so you want us to be more politically correct" and Iím like no, recovery language is more than being politically correct. Recovery language goes beyond being politically correct itís more content-based, for example rather than telling me that I am, I saw this crazy wild movie, why don't you say I saw this amazing movie it had awesome graphics or something of that nature. Learning how to use your words and be focused on building others.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Life is so much more manageable when I work my hardest to get enough sleep.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">For the first 12 years of living with my illness I had no concept of how important sleep was.  Finally my doctor told me that in order for my medication to even take effect I needed to be able to get at least 10, 8 to 10 hours of sleep and as you can imagine as an adult that can be really hard. But creating good sleep hygiene can be vital, so I really do what I can to prioritize my life around it and getting enough sleep.  If that means coming home early from an activity with friends or family or just forcing myself to turn off the phone turn off the commuter computer turn off everything, all the lights, itís vital. Something else that Iíve learned, I need to take my medicine about 1 to 2 hours before I intend on falling asleep because only when Iím able to do that am able to fall asleep on time and then get up on time the next morning.  In my life, when Iím starting to get less sleep. I start to recognize that life is a little bit more difficult to handle my emotions are more difficult to regulate and so when I start getting less than 8 to 10 hours for example letís say I got four hours of sleep then the next day I really have to catch up and so sometimes I need to call my doctor in order to help me get to sleep so we can adjust things because often times the things that work for everyday people donít who donít have a mental illness like mine they have no problem falling asleep however thatís not the case for me I can have everything turned off and even work my hardest to fall asleep and for whatever reason my brain just doesnít go to sleep.  Life is so much more manageable when I work my hardest to get enough sleep.</Content>

So sometimes when you talk to us we might have to hear things more than once simply because it does take quite a bit longer for my brain to process things.  When Iím not symptomatic and when Iím used to my medication itís no longer a problem so you can talk to me just as you talk to anyone else.</Content>

Learning about the psychiatric emergency response team or PERT, thatís a great resource to have available and understand how that might work and then also taking the NAMI Family-to-Family course. I learned so much taking that course because not only did it teach me about my family member and what they might be experiencing and how to communicate differently, it also helped me to prepare.

<Content id="0">If you have a loved one that has been arrested one of the first things that you should do is contact the jail and fax them information regarding their mental health history.  This will be useful to them as they try to help them to accept treatment. They do offer mental health treatment within the San Diego County jail system, and just making sure that they have a history what medications what the diagnosis may be and that can be useful. Thereís also additional information on our website about what to do in my family member is arrested and it gives you tips and ideas about should you use the public defenderís office or make the decision to have private counsel.  And it, just being there for your loved one, is still a great time to connect with your loved one while theyíre in jail because sometimes they've just been waiting for someone to reach out to them possibly and hear with their needs are.  You can also take this opportunity to visit your loved one while theyíre there and maybe thatís a good time to talk about options for them to try, and talk through the reasons that they might have ended up there.  Offer them the resources that you might have found out that they could possibly try. There is also a list of other questions and answers on our website, where you can, about what happens when once someone is in jail or prison and what can happen during the court process.  And if you can, even being there available to them in the court, they may not be able to see you or talk with you, but letting them know that youíre going to try and be there during the hearing because that can be a comfort to them as well.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Who can I talk to if I have a complaint about services?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">I work for the legal aid Society of San Diego we are a civil law firm and I work in the consumer center for health education advocacy department within the legal aid Society and we have the title IX contract with the county to deal with all of the outpatient mental health appeals and grievances and complaints. If youíre having a problem with your county funded or Medi-Cal funded provider of mental health services you can call us and we can investigate the problem. We can even just answer questions if you are unsure if you want to actually open an appeal or grievance.  We along with Jewish Family Services deal with all of the county and Medi-Cal funded appeals and grievances processes. JFS does the inpatient and we handle all the outpatient cases.  If youíve been denied services or your services have been terminated or theyíve changed or you are having trouble with the provider or with a community center or wherever you might be getting your mental health services we can investigate your issues and we work both with you and the providers and the county to try and resolve the issue the appeals process are when youíve been denied services, itís usually a denial of access to psychotherapy sessions so if for some reason you and your therapist believe that you have been denied additional services, or your services have been drastically altered in scope.  itís a 45 day process the very quick turnaround and we work with your providers get your medical records investigated have our independent clinical consultant review everything and make a determination to the county.  The county then makes a decision and we get back with you with the results. After we and our clinical therapist clinical consultant review the records quite often the county will agree with our determination that shows that you should be receiving additional psychotherapy services. If you are eligible you might be able to actually be able to see your therapist during the appeals process which is a wonderful thing so please contact us as soon as you get any letters stating that youíve been denied services as thatís a very short timeframe.  The grievance processes is a little different.  The grievance process could be about if youíre unhappy with your therapist or you had to wait too long for session one day or you couldnít get in or you couldnít be seen or maybe staff were rude to you any complaints that you might have about your provider or your care we can look into and hopefully resolve for you so that you are happy with your services again.  Itís a 60 day process where we do a similar situation where we talked the providers to get your records investigate the issues and try and come up with a resolution that is in your desired outcomes but also that the provider feels comfortable implementing and we also if your provider is not Medi-Cal or county funded we can do whatís called a complaint and look into your issues as well that doesnít really have a timeline thatís more kind of on a timely manner there is no deadline for that.  They have no timeframe but we try to do it in a timely manner.
You have certain additional rights as a mental health client and weíd like you to take advantage of those so please if you donít feel that you have been denied services for a legitimate reason please call us and we can look into that also if you have county funded or Medi-Cal funded services with a provider that you are unhappy with the service suppose you are unhappy with how your doctor is treating you or may be another staff member or itís taken too long to get into see a doctor or maybe you had to wait around for a long time once you were there for the appointment maybe you felt you had your confidentiality violated by a member of the staff thereís a number of reasons you may feel uncomfortable with your mental health care if you call us we can also look into your case and find out exactly what the issue is and come up with a findings that work with both you and your provider to find a suitable outcome that looks at all the sides of the problem.  We are the department within the legal aid Society that deals with all sorts of consumer health issues. So if you have questions we are good place to call and see if we can answer it and if not we can at least direct you to where you might want to go</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">The Internet is a lot like being in a very noisy cafeteria with a lot of people talking.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">When I talk to seniors as a part of the senior mobile technology lab I tend to try and emphasize that the Internet is a lot like being in a very noisy cafeteria with a lot of people talking and just like a telephone where you need to be connected to the phone line to be able to make a call your computer is a lot like that connection and as soon as you connect to the Internet anyone who is a part of that conversation has a chance to look at your digital information. So itís very important to not only understand that as soon as Iím connected to the Internet the Internet is also connected to me.  So when Iím on Facebook not only am I making posts but my friends, and depending on what my privacy settings are set at, friends of friends or maybe the public can also see my posts.  So one of the common scams that we keep hearing about is someone gets your information from Facebook especially if your privacy settings are set to public and then they appear as a friend or family member saying "Help I need, Iím in trouble" maybe "I need to be bailed out please send me money/"  Weíve all heard about these scams from especially African countries who say youíve won the lot of money please send me your information.  So older adults definitely need to hear that you never give out your information, never give out your name, never to give out your Social Security number, and surely never give out your banking information. If youíre going to do Internet banking do it in the bank other things you can do to protect yourself is on your mobile devices if youíre not actually using the Internet you can turn your Wi-Fi off you donít actually have to be on if youíre not using it. And the same thing for your desktop computer you can actually unplug it so that the Internet is not connected to you anymore. Some of the other things that they might want to look into is when theyíre doing their email make sure that they are always getting a subject on their emails this is both when they send things out and also when they get them.  One of the ways spam filters look for good emails is that thereís a subject that makes sense so when youíre sending them make sure you say "hey hi itís Joe," or you know "hey I really enjoyed such and such."  but also when you look for an email make sure that the subject makes sense and that who itís from is someone that you recognize.  And if for some reason you donít recognize the person you can email them back and say "hey who are you?" Another thing on Facebook just because someone tries to friend you, you do not have to friend them back.  If I get a random person saying "hey I want to be your friend" I often decline it and then go to their page and email them a kind of thing saying who are you, how do you know me, why do you want to be my friend ? And thatís perfectly legitimate just because someone asks to be my friend I donít have to be their friend back.  And if they donít take the time to answer me a one-word thing, "oh I met you at such and such an activity and you suggested I friend you on Facebook" then theyíre not worth taking the chances of your information getting out in hands that you donít want to have access to your information.  We have the website itís kind of in the process of being made so itís not fully formed yet but we have information about where were going to be where the seniors can come and talk to us were all throughout the county. Also the NAMI website is going to have access to their tech cafÈ information where it has wonderful links to various sites that have YouTube videos and webinars about this kind of information. But my favorite place to go to get information about seniors and technology is YouTube.  If you put in their search bar "seniors and the Internet" it will bring up a ton of wonderful videos about scams or about security issues and you can learn about it there. Thereís also a number of really amazing websites specifically about seniors in the Internet and theyíll have hundreds of articles where you can go and read. So this information is out there on the Internet if you want to find it for your family member or your loved one. And I would say the best thing for your senior who is maybe a little shy around technology is, just sit down with them.  We can go out all around the county and seniors are hungry for this kind of information they really want to learn but you know computers are pretty confusing right now and theyíre very very complicated itís not like they can just go and twiddle around on their own. We have seniors that come to our labs who donít know where the on button is, they donít know what double-clicking is to open up a program, so if you just sit down and kind of show them the basics then they can get a little bit comfortable and maybe then theyíll be googling on their own and they can find these kind of information for themselves.</Content>

Thereís people that are calling every day needing help and they donít even know why theyíre calling they just know that they were handed a card and they were told call this number.  And I wake up in the morning and I just know that I have to come here because there are people that are calling that need a good voice to talk to.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is it like being a Peer Specialist?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">This work is very rewarding and itís just so important not just as a peer specialist but working within the mental health community helping bring awareness, helping bring to light what is going on, changing lives. I think that is the big thing for me. Helping people understand that this is an illness.  Thereís nothing wrong with you, itís an illness just like anything else and we can treat it as such.  And the stigma of what mental health is, not everyone with a mental illness is crazy or will be violent or anything like that.  Itís just people that are hurting and we all hurt in different ways, and just some hurt a little bit more than others.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">When I took the class it was a very transforming.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">At the beginning I didnít know what I was going to learn from the classes. All I wanted to know, that I needed, was help for my son. I want to learn to learn everything that I could about mental illness.  So when I took the class it was a very transforming. At the beginning I was screaming at him. I was frustrated with him.  I was  screaming and hoping that he would come out of it, you know, on his own.  But after I took the class, especially with when they talk about communication, communication skills that they teach in the Family-to-Family class in the seventh, seventh or eighth class, that really change my mind about how to talk to him.  It really made me sad and it hurt me tremendously in my heart, all the bad things that I said to him, you know, without knowing that he couldnít help it.  He couldnít help what he was going through.  And so when I finished the class I was just, it gave me a different outlook on him, and I just hug him and kiss him and say Iím here for you, no matter what Iím here for you.  Weíre closer, I know when to hug him.  I know when to stay away from him. I know when we can talk.  And when he needs his time I just leave him alone and we just have a good relationship.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">I learned that you have to tell him one thing at a time.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">When I would talk to him, I did want him to help me around the house, so I would say you know could you please help me with the dishes, cleaning the dishes. I would have to tell him one thing at a time.  One thing that I wanted him to do.  So like, can you sweep the kitchen, and can you know clean, like, make your bed. I would have to say one thing at a time because before the class I was like "clean the kitchen, do the dishes, and mop the kitchen." So I would tell him three like three or four times and he was like no, youíre telling me too many things.  So after I took the class I learned that you have to tell him one thing at a time. And, when he's done with that, then I can ask him to do another thing.  And so heís comfortable with that. And so now I say, I feel better if you would comb your hair.  I appreciate if you donít smoke in the house. I would say I feel better, instead of you never help me with this, and you never do anything. I say, I would like you to help me with something. I would feel better if you would listen to me. I feel better if you come on time when I ask you, things like that. And so the relationship is better.</Content>

<Content id="0">I don't know if it was the stigma, but I donít know anybody else that had a loved one with mental illness. I didnít.  Probably we donít talk about it.  When my son started having these behavioral problems I thought he was using drugs or something because his behavior was so different that Iíve never seen him like that.  I have an older sister that she suffers from bipolar disorder and so my brother-in-law supposedly saw this in her mood changes and then he would say that we were possessed, that we are possessed in our side of the family.  And so this disturbed me a lot.  As I learned about the classes and I learned about mental illness, itís just a big stigma.  We just donít talk about mental illness.   It's an illness, you know, just we just donít know about it and we say, oh sheís depressed.  Depression is how we identify mental illness, I suppose.</Content>

<Content id="0">Recovery with mental illness is a live a little different than recovery with other ailments.  If you have a head cold or you have the flu you can usually take some medicine and you're recovered.  You're all better. You donít have symptoms of a cold or flu anymore. With mental illness itís a little different, in that recovery is really, is kind of a journey and a process rather than just a destination. And itís basically kind of living well with what weíve got. And it is something that people can... The recovery process just looks a little different.  People can go into remission they donít have signs and symptoms of mental illness.  Sometimes that can come back and they have to have certain tweaks in their medication or in their counseling or whatever their individual treatment plan is.</Content>

If the person comes in and says looks I really I really donít want to take medication, I want to take herbal or want to do this or do that, then that is something that really needs to be decided upon between the individual and their treatment team.</Content>

<Content id="0">Thereís just so many different aspects of recovery, I mean thereís, for me itís, I have two dogs now and theyíre just an amazing part, animal therapy is an amazing part of my recovery.  Music therapy, I'm  a musician.   Different aspects of spirituality.  There are just so many different avenues that lead towards recovery for people. It has to be just a really holistic, and the wholeness of it, it, has to be really, just everything is addressed, mind-body, spiritual, emotional, physical, all of the different things, you know, coping skills.  Itís not just taking medication and going to therapy. Itís so many, many more things.</Content>

<Content id="0">Sleep really is so important. I know for myself, if I donít get enough sleep Iím just pretty much shot for the day. I have to have a routine.  A routine is very important and within that routine for me itís eight hours at least of sleep, sometimes some naps during the day.  Itís also being able to eat well, being able to have a healthy diet, things in moderation and exercise also really. Thereís a lot of studies out there that say that exercise is a really good anti-depressant. And so, for me, I love to surf. Whenever I get out and surf itís an amazing, amazing time for me and it just really nurtures my soul and it really helps me keep my symptoms in check.</Content>

<Content id="0">Before I took a certain medication for my obsessive-compulsive disorder, I was just trapped in my obsessive, looping negative thoughts. And I could not function outside of that prison, really. Until I started taking a certain medication.  And once I started taking that medication, for me it just worked very quickly and really released me from the prison.  And there have been side effects from that that medication some have been lethargy, weight gain, that type of thing.  And, you know, I never like to take more medication than I have to, I like to keep it at a minimum. But for me personally, and I think for a lot of people, this is probably the case the benefits of not being trapped in that negative thinking, negative loop prison.  And taking the medication is just itís worth it to be out of that prison and to be out of  those symptoms.  And so Iíll deal with the side effects in the best way that I can, but for me the benefits outweigh the negative aspects of the medication.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Hope is so important.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Hope is so important.  Itís just vital. It is so vital to my recovery process that I actually have it tattooed on my arm.  And this is an arm, Iíll give you little back story on my arm here, this is an arm I used to compulsively cut and abuse when I was younger as part of my negative coping skills.  And years later, years later, I was an adult and I decided to do something that would commemorate this, decided to do something that would be a tribute to my journey of recovery.  So I had four words and some pictures tattooed onto my arm.  The words are compassion, healing, hope, and love. And what joins these are pictures of my dog in the ocean and surfboards and things that are very important to me to maintain that hope.  And I believe that if I feel like I am having a really bad day and I just look down at my wrist and I see compassion written on my wrist, I call this part of my anti-suicide tattoo, and that gives me hope.  They give me hope for myself, it gives me hope for having compassion for other people, for this world, and it just makes me pause and really take that in and what that means another way that I.  So this is a very tangible coping skill for me these tattoos and another very tangible coping skill is my dogs. I just got a puppy.  The first dog that I got was an amazing little antidepressant when I got her a decade ago.  I had just got out of the hospital and I was taking, I almost named her Prozac when I got her because she was such an amazing little antidepressant.  Golden retriever, sheís now 11 years old and we just got a new puppy who is 10 weeks old.  And thereís nothing like a dog or any animal really, cats whatever, a pet is just an incredible source of hope and love.  Unconditional love.  Theyíre always happy to see you.  And thereís also the responsibility of taking care of them.  If I didnít have the dogs I wouldnít some days get up in the morning.  They give me a purpose.  They give me a purpose outside of myself and that is really what kind of constitutes hope for me.  Another part of hope for me is my spirituality. The church that I go to, the friends that I have, the faith that I try to keep, thatís part of the hope as well.  And my family is definitely a part of my hope keeping.  Sometimes they're a bit of a challenge, you sometimes we just.  Life is a process. Life is a journey and we have to keep the hope and we have to be able to speak about it to one another, to ourselves, and to me thatís what recovery is about. Itís making every day worth it.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">We are all really the face of recovery.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Recovery looks so different from many people itís so individual I donít want people to look at me as the face of recovery because we are all really the face of recovery.  Recovery is not linear. We can feel like, maybe one day our symptoms are managed better than another day, but that doesnít mean that the day that our symptoms are not managed and were feeling depressed, or were feeling manic, or were feeling really, really, you know, in symptom, it doesnít mean that we havenít, that were not on the road to recovery.   It just means that we are in symptom. And we need to have coping skills and we need to have tools we need to have things we can do that are beneficial to help alleviate those symptoms.  But itís all part of the path, itís all part of the pathway of recovery.  So I would say if you donít believe in recovery, thatís okay.  Thatís part of the process. Itís okay, just keep working at whatever it is thatís part of your own individual plan.  And that in itself really is recovery because, like I said, itís a journey, and a process rather than just the destination. So if youíre one step forward, two steps back, or two steps forward, one step back, itís okay.  Have compassion for yourself, and go ahead and take the next step on that journey because itís going to be alright and you are living in recovery.</Content>

<Content id="0">Well the first thing I would say is to find someone who is compassionate and understanding and nonjudgmental.  Sometimes that is a family member, sometimes itís not, but definitely someone that you can feel comfortable talking with. Perhaps a school counselor if youíre in school.  Perhaps a pastor or a church member if you go to a faith community.  And also thereís help lines and chat rooms that you can actually contact.  And the best thing actually is to connect with, with some sort of a support group and find a mentor or another peer, someone thatís living with mental illness in recovery and that you can kind of talk to them about some of the issues.</Content>

<Content id="0">The peer model works really really well because itís an avenue for someone thatís going through an experience with mental illness to actually talk with someone that really really understands.  A peer or an individual thatís been there, done that and is on the other side living in recovery is the most heartfelt and hope producing type of communication someone thatís suffering with some symptoms could actually have.  Storytelling is healing because it allows the individual to express some perhaps some things that are difficult to communicate. And when we tell our story and we share that, each time thereís more and more understanding internally and itís part of the healing process to actually be able to speak and not to hide it inside</Content>

<Content id="0">Recovery means living a life unencumbered and unaffected on a regular basis by the effects or the symptoms of mental illness. To be able to live life without stigma. To be okay in my own skin and to feel good about a contribution to society and not be symptomatic.  Recovery is not linear.  Recovery can take many facets for various reasons for various types of individuals, but as a rule recovery is a learning process. Itís about the journey and the destination ultimately is a life lived well, a life lived in balance, a life relatively free of symptoms, or symptoms that can be managed.</Content>

To give hope, to educate, and to reduce the stigma.  Itís a presentation that includes a video, goes through five different segments of living with mental illness from dark days all the way through to success, hopes and dreams.  It covers topics such as coping skills, acceptance and treatment and thereís a question and answer period after.  Itís engaging with the audience.

What works for me to maintain my recovery is really first and foremost being honest with myself not trying to sugarcoat anything I may be feeling and not to deny any symptoms or emotional states I may be experiencing.  Adhering to a well-balanced diet of healthy foods, exercise is super important, addressing my creative side whether itís cooking or gardening or singing.  And also adhering to my treatment plan, for me that includes medication and also includes therapy and some group support.  And when one of those aspects is out of balance it really affects the whole.</Content>

<Content id="0">For me thereís a strong corollary between physical and mental health. I personally experience some symptoms physically when Iím in over whelmed or when Iím dealing with a bout of depression.  Our mind, our brain is the biggest organ in the body than controls pretty much everything in our body one way or another. And so for me, when Iím in symptom or perhaps switching medications or switching therapists, I can feel that in my body.  Thereís a physical feeling of tiredness perhaps a feeling of stress, just as when Iím living well consistently thereís balance and peace.</Content>

<Content id="0">The next steps program started on January 1, 2015. Itís a county funded program under the present invention and early intervention area.   We are a partnership of four agencies. NAMI San Diego is the leading agency. We're also partnered with family health centers, mental health systems and UPAC.  And we're unique program because we provide integrated care supplied by individuals with lived experience, and these include individuals with mental health experience, alcohol and drug experience, and physical health issues.  And, we are located in the HHS a building on Rosecrans right beside County psychiatric hospital. And we have staff both in the hospital and in the community.  And in the hospital we engage individuals and their significant others in the emergency room and also on the inpatient units where they are from 830 in the morning till 930 at night, seven days a week.  And we are trying to assist people in a very difficult time in their lives, providing support and engagement, interesting them in our program, and, if itís appropriate for them and theyíre willing, we sign them up for the program. And then our community staff, once they're released follow them into the community and we provide information resources on any area that theyíre interested in and that can include mental health treatment, alcohol and drug treatment, physical health services, housing benefits, and anything else, you know people are interested in.  How we meet with client when we're in the community at a location of their choice, that could be their home, that could be in a clinic, could be in the park, could be at Starbucks, whatever feels comfortable to them.  Now that we are growing we are often seeing individuals with a team of folks so that that might mean a team of, that might mean an individual might have a, they might be working with a recovery service counselor, if they have physical health counselor theyíll be working with one of our health navigators, so we really try to provide the full spectrum of care to individuals.  And of course our goal is to help stabilize folks in the community encourage them in recovery provide them with hope and hopefully minimize the return to the emergency room and the psychiatric hospital.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Our staff are confronting these issues in their own lives every day.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Our staffing is very diverse.  We try to have staff that represents the communities.  We have staff of a variety of ages from 20s to 60s plus.  They represented a variety of ethnic and racial groups and they also speak four of the five threshold languages in the county.  We have staff that speak four of the five County threshold languages which includes Spanish Vietnamese as well as English.   The only language we donít have represented is Arabic which is been very difficult to find someone that speaks Arabic we are always looking.

Essentially all our staff have lived experience and itís critical because they can understand and empathize in way that others canít with what our individuals are in their significant others are going through.  In terms of the peers, you know, theyíve been there with themselves either with their mental health issues, substance use issues, or both in terms of our family specialists there.  They have family members with lived experience so they know when itís like to be a family member or significant other of someone with mental health experience.  And our staff are confronting these issues in their own lives every day.  Just because theyíre in our workforce doesnít mean that their lives are always smooth. They're all focus on the recovery trying to make sure that they maintain hope for themselves and others.  And again I think that they connect with individuals in a way that people without lived experience can't relate to.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">So that nobody felt alone after they were leaving their loved one behind.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Friends in the Lobby is a hospital-based program that has family members and individuals with mental illness that have been trained by NAMI San Diego in lobbies of psychiatric inpatient hospitals.  The program was designed and developed because a lot of times family members would go to a hospital to visit their loved ones, they would get this short period of time to interact and any have some free time with their loved one, and then they leave that person behind with maybe some doubts or concerns or just feeling may be some isolation and shame over it. And there was nobody there to talk to that person about what was the next step for them, what were resources in the community, what could they do to empower themselves, or their loved one when they were going to be released the hospital.  And a lot of times a lot of people would feel an emotion that when they would leave the locked unit, and the hospital doors would shut and they make this very loud clicking noise, it would really trigger an emotional response.  And a lot of times and I myself as a family member would want to break down and cry at that moment. Instead I would make it to the car and then cry on the way home and still feeling very much alone after I had left my brother behind.  So what we did was we train family members and peers, individuals with mental illness to be right outside that lobby so that nobody felt alone after they were leaving their loved one behind.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">If youíre feeling isolated, shame, a stigma ,,, youíre less likely to feel comfortable seeking out treatment.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">While there are a lot of reasons why people may or may not seek out treatment, and while we tell the community that mental illness is just the same as any other physical health issue in this aspect, it can be quite different. And there was a great author who was also a psychologist and he had a met a behavioral health psychologist and he turned out the difference between MS and the behavioral health world. And in MS you enter your field of medical care via trust. You trust your doctors, you trust the medicine, you trust the provider and support world.  Where is a lot of time people with mental illness are entering the mental health world via maybe a police officer, so if theyíve been handcuffed because they have no notice that they are constantly behind in their health, and theyíre taken to the hospital.  That individual enters the mental health world in a period of distrust. And they have to rebuild these bonds of distrust In order to really feel comfortable seeking out treatment. Also that's really not the only reason access to treatment sometimes would not happen.  And the broader community around media really shows mental illness in a very shameful light that causes a lot of stigma. And a person doesnít want to be associated with a lot of this negative attention that is being received by mental illness in our modern community.  So if youíre feeling isolated, shame, a stigma around a disorder youíre less likely to feel comfortable seeking out treatment for that disorder that has such a negative connotation.  So what we need to do as community is really break down these barriers in order for people to feel comfortable seeking out treatment at that first moment that they need it and not wait until it gets to a point where we need to have this intervention or any other forms of intervention.</Content>

To really normalize it.  To really see that recovery is possible, that people can work, a mental illness is not an equal association with acts of violence in this community.  That's the only way I can really see us breaking down stigma, which NAMI San Diego provides through our outreach and speakers  programs, through a lot of different organizations that really focus on showing that people with mental illness recover.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">There was a period of time when Iíd always become angry with my brother.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">I'm a sibling of someone who has a mental illness.  My brother was actually diagnosed with schizophrenia at the age of 19, but if you actually talk to him he would say that some of his symptoms started around the age of 15.  So he started having auditory hallucinations and he really had a hard time connecting with his friends.  And when his diagnosis hit he had been voted class clown and he lost all of his friends. During this period of time, I was also at college so my parents were going through a lot of emotional crisis when my brother became ill. And I was disconnected even though I was also very close to my brother at the same time.  And then as we were going through his recovery journey, and had a lot of hospitalizations, a lot of interaction with the police, there was a period of time when Iíd always become angry with my brother.  I felt in some ways that he was taking my parents away from me because they needed to spend so much time and energy with him.  But I was having a hard time being able to, I didnít need to forgive him, but understand what he was going through with his journey with mental illness.  So it took me the time to really seek out my own support needs and make sure that I connected with my brother and my parents and even spoke up about the trouble that I was having.  Because thereís a difference, as a parent, youíre going through a lot of emotional support issues around your child and their illness and you need to take on their recovery.  You're very focused with your child.   A sister or brother can actually be very separate and can flee the situation. So what I would ask of any sibling is that you donít leave your sibling behind.  That you keep that connection as much is possible.  That you donít lose hope,  That you understand recovery is possible and help your sibling on their journey.  So go to hospitalization visits if they end up in the hospital.   Offer to go to treatment appointments with the psychiatrist.  Take them to the movies every now and then, just keep that interaction because thereís too many times that Iíve talked to siblings too late, where their loved one had passed away, had died by suicide, their journeys in life took them separate ways, and now, now that person is gone and they can never rectify or be with that loved one again.   And they miss those 20, 30, 40 years that they could have had with their sister or brother so if I could ask a sibling to do anything, itís to not lose hope.</Content>

<Content id="0">If I was to try to find a place for my loved one to live that had mental illness, I would first go to 211 San Diego.org or you can dial 211 San Diego.  They have a list of the independent livings that are in San Diego County as well as the Boarding Cares.  To know which one is most appropriate for you,  If you were to be a person with that needed medication management, supervision and care, you would look for a boarding care in your area.   And Boarding Cares are governed by the community care licensing.  If there are any issues with the standards in Boarding Cares, thatís who you would go to, would be community care licensing.   For independent livings, they have an Independent Living Association.   You can also go to ilasd.org and they would have all of the different housing that they have available as well on their website.  Independent livings are the exact opposite of boarding cares, they are for people that donít need medication management supervision or care and they are people that are able to live independently, but the Independent Living Association will make sure that they terrific homes to live in and they have standard standards that they set.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I tell what the most appropriate housing is?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">When it comes to looking for housing for your loved one, I would absolutely recommend that you look into the type of housing first, so if that person needed an independent living or boarding care, visit the facility yourself.  They should be more than welcoming to have you come in, take a look at the standards that they have set, and making sure that that environment is the right housing for you.  Sometimes you might want, you know, you need to have a single bed, but you find out later that thereís two beds per room in that place.  You might want to make sure that you are in an environment where you can be comfortable, that you know, if youíre person that sleeps, goes to bed late, and your roommate goes to bed early you donít want to be disturbing them every single that there are there. You want to make sure that your both able to live in an environment where you guys can get better and so itís really important to make sure that check it out make sure that the standards are up to your standards and just make sure itís a great environment.  No one should ever feel guilty about signing their loved one to a, taking them out of their home and getting them into another type of housing.  The environments of these places are, they're meant for people that need that type of supervision, medication management and care.   And if youíre not able to provide it you should really look into having, placing your individual in a place like that because they have the resources there to take care of your loved one.</Content>

<Content id="0">In terms of finding a loved one a home outside of your home itís really important to understand that it can be a positive experience for both of you in terms of relationship.  If that person, if your loved one is in a home where theyíre getting the best of the care that they can, if they need medication management, if they need supervision, if they need care, itís going to be really great if there able to get that and not feel like sometimes,  feel like there are a burden on their families.  Depending what they go through itís not the case.  Family members always want to be there for the loved ones, but I think itís just sometimes you get that thought and it can really be helpful for your relationship if you are your able to focus on recovery and when youíre see your family are able focus on your family.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is independent living?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Independent livings got started because Deinstitutionalization happened.  So people didnít have a place to live anymore because they, the housing was available for them anymore.  So people, their neighbors opened up the doors to the people that in the community that had a mental illness but were stable to live on their own and be able to take care of their own medications and supervision and care.  So independent livings are they're not subsidize.  They're homes where an individual, a landlord open their home to a person that has is seeking housing.  It can be a person that has a mental illness, but it can also be for anybody that is seeking housing.  But they typically cater to people with mental illness.   They are found all throughout the community.  Typically itís a shared bedroom.  And the best place to find in independent living is through the Independent Living Association because the Independent Living Association looks for the quality with homes, and because Independent Livings are unregulated, theyíre not overseen by any government agency they really need to make sure that there a safe environment for your loved one to live in.  And the Independent Living Association make sure that that home is a safe to live in through their tight quality standards to look for when reviewing a house.  Just like any housing I would recommend that you please take a tour to the house of the house before you decide on that being a place for your loved one to live.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is Board and Care? -- Do not use -- need to edit off last part</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Boarding cares are for people that need medication management, supervision and care, So, these people are a little higher on the housing spectrum in terms of they mightíve just got out of the hospital they still need supervision and care, they need help with their ADLs, their activities of daily living, they may need help grooming, bathing, being reminded to take their medication, maybe storing some of their items because they might get lost, that sort of thing. Boarding cares are really good for, is really good for making sure that they have someone that is looking over them as much as possible to make sure that itís a great environment for them and that there able to focus on their recovery.  Independent Livings are regulated by community care licensing so if so if there is an issue with, in terms of standards at a boarding care, you can go to community care licensing and let them know about the issues that you might see in a boarding care.  But they do have a high quality and high standards within boarding care.</Content>

<Content id="0">So the best thing the parent can do if they have a child with who has either a behavioral health challenge or, I would like to say an exceptional circumstance, or an exceptional challenge, whether itís behavioral or developmental is to learn how to advocate for that child.  Learn how to advocate and learn how to build relationships with people outside of themselves. What I mean by that is actually learning how to partner with educational system's staff and administration.  Learning how to communicate effectively about what it is that your child is experiencing and so they can provide an opportunity for you to, I guess, access services and supports or lists of services and supports that may be able to help them in accessing their education.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Children that have experienced trauma are not likely to access their education the same way.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Trauma informed care or practice or parenting, is something that is evolving here I guess in San Diego, a lot of the institutions and agencies want to be trauma informed or a have trauma informed best practice. As a family member or as a parent, you know some of what your child has been experiencing at home, whether itís bullying whether itís domestic violence and to partner with agencies or providers in a very transparent way that would help them, you know, find a good fit for the services that would best address those things.  Children that have experienced trauma are not likely to access their education the same way that a child who has not had that experience.  So, and if theyíre not processing that or it hasnít been put in the right context for them, while theyíre in school they can be triggered by certain things.  And so if you have awareness of what those triggers are you can minimize the effects on how it is impacting their education.  So parents, being aware of what those triggers are, being very transparent about the traumas that have occurred in their life, and maybe talking to provider or a pediatrician about some screenings that they may be able to do.</Content>

So first, starting with your pediatrician and then doing some individual research on your own and then making those questions available at your next doctorís visit or provider consultation and so you can sort out which medications if any are appropriate for your young child.</Content>

<Content id="0">I think that a reasonable expectation is, number one you have to know your child.  I tell parents all the time you know they are the expert on their child, their child is an individual.  So what may be an appropriate amount of screen time for one child may be different for another family. When it comes to smaller children we should definitely be limiting their screen time. Because it does affect their developmental progress.  It also affects how theyíre able to attend in school, their attention span and also it can affect their mood. So I would say that you need to use technology responsibly as a parent, you should monitor, definitely utilize your advantage of having parental controls when it comes to television and for the media.  But I donít think that itís totally, you know, inappropriate for a child with behavioral illness health issues to be using technology because right now when it comes to education a lot of times they have smart screens smart boards and stuff so a lot of their schoolwork sometimes is connected to some of the social media.</Content>

<Content id="0">So there are so many available resources available out there when it comes to parents. I would say that your best resource is another parent so if you can find where other parents are, like playgroups, here we have Meet Up groups. Also I would say if you are a mom that has a child with Down Syndrome, you might want to join the Autism group. If youíre a family member that has a child with spina bifida you might want to join the group with someone who has a child that has MS, because most families that have children with exceptional needs and circumstances know the ropes so as far as supports and resources. Other parents are one of your best resources. And then you also have family resource centers, you have some Healthy Start programs.  Your pediatricians may also have focus groups or support groups for families that have children with special needs. You have entities like NAMI and Recovery Innovations, you also have family youth Roundtable.  There are many entities that provide resources for families that have children with exceptional needs and circumstances.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">The military comes with its own unique menu of stressors.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">So the military comes with its own, I would say, unique menu of stressors.  Coming from a military background myself, my father was a 24 year military veteran, so I grew up in a family where my mother often acted as a married single-parent.  And what I mean by that is that she had the sole responsibility of caring for us physically while my father was away providing service to his country.  And in doing that there is the additional stress of burnout and just caregiver fatigue and parental depression.  Some of the stressors that also affect the military are family violence.  Sometimes the military marry younger, they have children at a younger age, and sometimes you have you know that teenage dynamic in the home with people that have real adult responsibilities. So some the stressors that affect families everyday can be exasperated just by the fact that theyíre in the military. And thereís a lot of stigma with accessing behavioral health services in military life. Often times mothers are the only caregivers left behind to tend to children are not accessing behavioral health services because they feel that it would impact their spouse's career.  And so they donít utilize all the resources that may be available to them because they feel that itís going to affect their livelihood. So just assisting them or helping them to navigate around those barriers and accessing sustainable resources in their community that may or may not be associated with the military may be more helpful to them. And also parents, putting them with other moms who may have experienced depression or caregiver fatigue that they can actually overcome it by building a support inventory. So that's something that's really important for military families they learn how to build a support inventory and that providers realize that when theyíre moving from one state to another they have they may have lost their whole support system.   So how do we replace that we need to really build that into their lives so that they have that protective factor of other community, other family, natural supports being those that are going to be with you throughout their lifetime without payment, and formal supports often being those that are paid to being in their life, like a physician or psychiatrist.</Content>

<Content id="0">One of the resources that we have here in San Diego County is 211, so you can dial that from a landline thatís associated with our County or a cell phone.  211 gives you access to over 6000 resources within the database.  It used to be where you would have to go down to the HHSA or Health and Human Services or welfare or social services whatever you want to call it, to access resources. But now you can call 211 and they can actually do your screening for eligibility right over the phone. So you can take that first step over the phone. So thatís Cal-Fresh and also Medi-Cal or Cover California you could do the beginning part of that with 211.  Families can also call if they need behavioral health support so they can call with that question and they will connect them to another resource or give them a referral to something within our County.</Content>

<Content id="0">The first thing you could do is you want to get in touch with the DA and see if he what court your loved one is going to be set to they have a special behavioral court in San Diego County that set up for people that have mental health issues and if at all possible you want to get them into that courtroom.  If they're sent to the regular court, they will be judged like anybody else.  If itís determined that in court that he has a mental health issue and thatís the reason for his crime, for whatever he's done. You can request to have him evaluated. Okay. So then they will send them to the Patton State hospital for an evaluation.  Once he is there, they will determined if he does have a diagnosis they will treat him for that diagnosis, they will get them stabilized and then they will send them back to court, and back to San Diego to stand trial. Once they are in court, the new IHOT program, you can call them and asked them to advocate for you and they can go visit your child or your loved one while he's in court while he's in jail.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How do you deal with your loved one being incarcerated?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Me and my wife, we keep ourselves active. We are part of the criminal justice force group that we have here in San Diego County. There are families of who, of loved ones who are incarcerated.  We meet once a month, we get together we offer support and comfort to each other.  For myself I used to be self-employed.  Once my son was sent to jail, because heís not a criminal heís mentally ill, I thought it was unjust and I knew at that time that my son needed help, that if I wasnít going to help them nobody was.   So I shut my business down I went down to the NAMI office.  I started, I asked to volunteer.  I went into learn what I could do to help my son.  I was a volunteer for two years in the hope connection program.  I work at the San Diego County Psychiatric Hospital and I worked there as a families services support.  Now that program has been developed into the Next Steps program.  What happened was they were two programs, The Bridge to Recovery and there was Mental Health, and Hope Connection was mental health and Bridge to Recovery was alcohol and other drug issues, they combined the two programs so that itís now call the Next Steps program, so were all under one umbrella, and we handle all, we're help able to help all patients that come to the hospital.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What future do you see for your son?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">I think my son has learned that he needs medication.  He is 35 years old now heís been, he was first diagnosed at mental illness at the age of 19, so itís been a 16 your journey.  He is at that stage in his life now that he realizes that he does need help that there is something wrong.  Through proper medication and therapy, through support from his family and all of us heÖ I see that heíll be able to come, when he comes home will be able to function. Of course there will be issues and thereís always the chance of relapse and everything like that but at least heíll be home with family.  And now since Iíve been involved in the in NAMI for the last six years, working for NAMI, I know more about how to help him, how to best get him help.  The situation with him in the past before he went to prison was that he was on the wrong medication.  We as a family did not know how to fight for him to get the proper medication.  One of the, the drug that works for him was not one of the approved Medi-Cal drugs and because it was on the approved Medi-Cal drugs, it was involving a cost issue, they would not give it to him, they were giving the wrong medication.  After working with for NAMI now I know how to get him the proper medication. I know the channels. I know how to advocate for him, I know how to get him the proper medication that he needs.  And with the proper medication that he needs like I said heís as good as heíll never be the same, but heís as close to being himself as heíll ever be.</Content>

Itís for families, for new families who have a loved one who is being incarcerated or going to the court system.  It's for families whose loved ones are already in prison.  Iím very fortunate that the group of people that are attending the class now on a regular basis.  Thereís two other families that have their sons at Atascadero where my son is and we exchange information on, we're able to talk about whatís new, whatís going on.  Weíve actually even met up there at Atascadero itís a little town above San Luis Obispo. We meet up there and were able to visit our loved ones.  We are helping new families who are just beginning to go through the court system,  helping them with who to get in contact with, what information they might need to know, trying to get into the behavioral health court, knowing who to write a letter to, how to present your case to the judge to the court, anything that you might need help with where there to help you.   We meet once a month itís on the third Thursday of every month and itís a great group itís been a tremendous help to both me and my wife and our family.</Content>

<Content id="0">When the crisis of mental illness hits a family itís not only that your loved ones going through this, all family members go through this.  And thereís crisis, thereís misunderstanding, thereís hopelessness.  Mental health, for myself, mental health has been in my family since childhood.   And I thought I was away from it once I got married and started my own family.   And then when this happened to my son I was very, I made it about myself.  And I was ashamed of that.  What I did was instead of being able to help him, I was making, I felt like the victim.  I felt like, why is it me, and everything else?  And everything else, and you, being a father the cars broken you fix it.   If the tire's flat, you change a tire.  You need to fix the fence, it's something that you can do.   For me mental illness was something I couldnít, I didnít know anything about, I didnít how to take care of it.  I didnít know what to do and because of that I shut down, I pushed it off one of my wife.  I feel that other men do that that same thing.  I see that all the time, mostly to support groups, and the people in the families that I deal with are mostly the mothers and the women, the wives, the sisters or whatever.   Men have a hard time dealing with, dealing with things that they donít know, that they donít how to help.  And so once I was, what happened to me was that I realized it was pushing everything off and my wife.  And I saw that, what it was doing to her.  And I was afraid that I was going to lose her too, so thatís why got involved.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What I found works is listening more than telling.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Communicating with someone with a mental illness is a real challenge.  Often in my situation family members donít want to talk, they push you away.  The inclination is to try to convince them to recognize that they have an illness and that they need treatment, usually medication, to see a psychiatrist or whatever.  Very often that doesnít work.  So it gets more and more frustrating as you try harder and harder to get your message across.   What I found works is listening more than telling.   In other words, when I would go to my family member and leave my agenda outside and really try to understand what heís going through that actually helped a lot more.   Because you're dealing with a person who has their own perspective and you need to respect that perspective.  And the more that you can empathize, really listen deeply and empathize, the more that they trust you and upon that trust you can work together.  So that is that was a lesson that was difficult to learn.  Many times that I tried over and over again to say "Yes, but."  But, it was only when I really listened deeply and empathized that I felt like we were communicating.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">That personís defenses will be lower when they feel like theyíve been heard.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Thereís a famous saying by Albert Einstein that  the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.  So communicating with a loved one with mental illness, when you try over and over again to convince them that they have a mental illness, that they need help, if it doesnít work then you need to do something else. So when I found was, I hitting that wall and I didnít know what else to do.  And so I tried reaching out. I read articles online. I read books that were recommended to me.  One of the first things I did was take the NAMI Family-to-Family class, and there was a unit in there on communicating with your loved one that really helped me a lot.  Another book that was recommended is a book by Xavier Amador and itís called Iím Not Sick I Donít Need Help, which of course Iíd heard many times.  And it talked, in that book he talks about the LEAP method which is basically listening to what the person has to say, empathizing -- doesnít matter whether that what they have to say sounds irrational to you, or delusional, itís how does that, how would that feel to them.  So empathizing with them and then finding what you can agree on.  Because that personís defenses will be lower when they feel like theyíve been heard.  And then finally you can figure out what you can partner on.  So that book was very helpful. I still felt odd when I would go in to talk to my son.  I felt like I was walking on eggshells and thatís very common I knew he didnít want to talk about it he really didnít want to talk about any think as he was very depressed and withdrawn but I wanted to reach him somehow  and I didnít know what words to say. I would actually practice sometimes before going up to talk to him and I just felt awkward. So one of the final things that I did fairly recently was I worked with a company called Helios and they are partnering with NAMI in another part of the country, they're on the East Coast.  And they do videoconferencing with a therapist and itís all about communicating with your loved one in the things that helped me there was they took everything that I had learned elsewhere and gave me the words to say they actually got into the details of how to phrase the question to your loved one and how to do how to ask a question how to express an interest in having them do something and so I actually started using those and yes he feel really strange because youíre following a formula but the more I did it the more comfortable I felt and after about a month of doing that, nothing happens immediately you have to be patient, but after about a month of doing that my son I could tell that my son felt heard and not attacked or pressured.   He felt understood and he actually came to me and wanting my help, and that was that was mind boggling. That was amazing, and wonderful.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">You may have to change your strategies or your way of communicating.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Very often I would say, probably most often from what I hear and my own experience, loved ones with mental illness do not want help. They refuse or push back.   One of the things I debated was should I keep trying or should I stop.  So the answer is yes and no.  And what I mean by that is yes keep trying, you never give up because thereís always hope and over the years that Iíve been dealing with this Iíve met many people who have done things to improve their lives, recovered functioning that they never thought they would or that their loved ones never thought they would.  So thereís never any reason to give up hope.  But you have to change sometimes the way you encounter, the way you work with that person.  It's not a matter of do you give up or not, you never give up, but you may have to change your strategies or your way of communicating, your way of looking at your loved one.  Thereís always a way.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Sometimes people being open actually opens the door to finding out more about how not alone you are.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">One of the toughest things about dealing with a loved one with mental illness is feeling alone like youíre the only one going through this, that nobody is going to understand this.  The stigma makes it impossible, makes it feel impossible to talk about. And there are people in your life in your life that will not understand.  There were friends of mine that I knew just didnít get it when I started to try to explain and sometimes family members donít understand.   What I did in that situation was I reached out to support groups and also to the NAMI Family-to-Family class.  And as I did that I met other people who were going through the same thing.  And when you do that you donít feel alone and you realize that this is not uncommon.  There are a lot of people out there who are going through the same thing.   I went to a workshop once and the woman gave some advice which was very helpful, and she said you may actually have to drop some friendships or cool some family relationships because if they are arenít supportive then theyíre not helping. And you, for your own health, you may need to ease or to cut off those relationships.  And I actually did that with one friend.  And I needed to and I felt better after that.   And I replaced that friendship with others, with people from support groups and others that really did understand.  So I donít feel alone anymore. And the other thing is that once you, at least I began to talk a little bit more about it, I found that when I was more open about what I was dealing with people would come to me and say oh me too, Iíve never told anybody this before.  You would be amazed at how many people you know, you already know that are going through, that have a loved one with mental illness, or they're struggling with mental illness and they just never told anybody.  So sometimes people being open actually opens the door to finding out more about how not alone you are.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How do you take care of yourself?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">When I first started dealing with my sonís illness and going to support groups going to classes people were constantly saying to me what you doing to take care of yourself my answer was itís not about me itís about my son I have to fix him.  I have to figure out how to fix them.   And they kept coming back to, "well, but what about you?"  And eventually I learned that it really was about me.  That if I didnít take care of myself, I wasnít to be of any use to anybody else.   And itís like that old,  well is not so old, but they talk about in the flight instructions we you get on a plane in the case of an emergency in the oxygen drops mask drops you put on yourself first before you put it on your children.  So you have to take care of yourself and I, so I started focusing on what I could do for myself I needed to have a life again.  And I took up gardening it was one of the things that Iíd never garden before.  And I actually found that there are a lot of lessons that I learned in gardening that were applicable to the situation in my family.  One was I had to tomato plants to start with, by the way of a terrible gardener I never did get very good at it, but started with two tomato plants, bought them for the same price in the same kinds of pots, put them right next to each other.  I watered them exactly the same. I fertilized them exactly the same, everything was the same.  And then one day about a month later I remember taking a look at them seeing them from a distance and noted that one was thriving and the other one was struggling to survive.   And I started to cry because I saw my two sons and at that moment I realized that it wasnít my fault. I was able to let go of that. I had raised my sons the same and that this illness that struck my younger son was not his fault, it wasnít my fault.  So that was a major lesson to learn.  The other lesson I learned from gardening was a lesson about hope.  After the tomato season was long gone, and this was, I grew many tomato plants but six months later they were all dead and gone, it was the winter and tomatoes donít grow in the winter, but I went outside one day and in the corner of my yard, in a barren part of my yard, there was a tomato plant growing. And I hadnít planted it, I hadnít watered it and this thing was growing.  And it was healthy and it had tomatoes on it.  And I looked at that and I said thereís always hope. The things that, that was impossible.   And again I looked at that and I thought thereís no reason not to hope that my son can, can do things that we think now are impossible.  So those are my lessons from the garden.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Just because you get older, doesn't mean you'll have mental health challenges.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">So with older adults is pretty common to think that as we get older itís a natural process for everyone to have mental health challenges, But thatís not necessarily the case. Some older adults are fine throughout their life and even in their later years, of course they may have some transitions were they may have some ups and downs, but it may not impact them severely. There are going to be other individuals who have struggled with depression or other forms of mental illness throughout their entire life and they also experience it later in life.  Thereís a third group of individuals who may have been fine through most of their adult years, but as they get into their older adult years they face certain losses or certain health challenges which may lead to some mental health challenges.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Link between physical challenges and mental illness</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Older adults often face many physical challenges as they get older. They may have problems with mobility, they may have chronic conditions such as a heart condition or diabetes, all of which may have some impact on how theyíre feeling and thinking.  Some of them may have a direct relationship such as diabetes, because diabetes, when your sugar level is low, then  it also impacts your mood.  So there is a relationship.  You may also see some individuals who have problem with a stroke that may also lead to some depression. But, it doesnít mean that all physical disabilities or all physical challenges cause mental illness. But certainly there is a stronger relationship with somebody who has physical challenges to also potentially have some mental health challenges.  One example would be a person who has some mobility issues; maybe they were an athlete in their younger years then they had a hip fracture and they werenít able to go out and see their friends as often as they could.  And certainly anybody in that situation would have some challenges unless they had a friend, unless they had a family member who could still take them out to their usual social activities to the market to wherever they needed to be.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Suicide risk in older adults</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The suicide risk in older adults is quite high.  There are reports that suggest that older adults are at the highest risk, particularly white males.  There are also other reports that suggest that they are the second highest group, first being young adults. In either case, this is something that one needs to pay attention to, especially as older adults become more isolated; perhaps their spouse or their partner becomes deceased or maybe they just donít have a lot of friends or family around, not a big social group. And thatís really one of the things that needs to be monitored, is how active are they in their community, how active are they physically, even spiritually. Are they taking care of their diet and things like that?  So those all point to depression and as depression becomes more severe thatís when a suicide becomes more at risk.

One other thing to think about with suicide risk is that a lot of older adults, because many of them have either chronic conditions or some other kind of health conditions, they are taking a variety of medications.  Some of these medications may be overused or misused.  And some individuals may take those medications incorrectly in combination with alcohol which puts them at a higher risk.  So those are all things to take into consideration with older adults and suicide.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Family members are very important with supporting older adults with mental illness.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Family members are very important with supporting individuals, older adults with mental illness. And, once again we need to think about, has this older adult experience mental illness throughout their life or is it their first time?  If itís really their first time experiencing a mental health challenge, then the family member really wants to bring it to attention to that loved one. Most likely the loved one will try to minimize it and say "oh no, itís not that big of a deal." But what would be helpful is going with them to a doctor's appointment and explaining to the doctor or to the nurse, "this is what Iíve seen in my mom or dad.  Iím really concerned.  He or she says he feels fine, but they actually, they stopped eating, they start, donít see their friends anymore, they donít go to church anymore, the house is a mess, they stop paying for the bills," and things like that.  So really explaining that to a medical professional.  And, you know, also directly asking the medical professional, "do you think this person needs to see a mental health professional for a screening for depression or mental illness?" You know, itís totally okay to ask for that, because sometimes some medical professionals need that nudge.  And actually thatís where most of our older adults will go to seek treatment first, is that they will feel comfortable in going to a medical professional, they will feel less comfortable going to a traditional mental health clinic.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Many older adults don't have the language for describing what they're feeling.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Sometimes itís difficult to diagnose mental illness in older adults because many older adults donít really have the language for describing what they're feeling. They grew up in a culture where people were told to keep things to themselves.  They were told to keep feelings to themselves. So the only thing that they feel, that they do feel comfortable and talking about is how theyíre feeling physically: my back aches, my head aches my stomach aches.  To be able to say comfortably, especially to the stranger, "I feel sad," "I felt sad for the past, you know, three months," or,  "I hear things that other people donít hear." That really brings a lot of shame to individuals.  And you know as part of the aging process we all feel our bodies changing in a lot of different ways,  so it's also easy to just say itís a part of being older, I guess this is just how it is.  And so thatís where itís very difficult to really pinpoint where, you know, what is the cause of it.  You know, socially they see other seniors who have experienced losses and they think that thatís just part of the norm, so thatís where it makes it difficult to see whatís happening.</Content>

<Content id="0">Family members are an important part of an older adult getting treatment and succeeding in treatment.  But one thing to keep in mind is that family members themselves may be older adults.  And so they might be the one trying to be the strong one, where they themselves might also be kind of in a closet in terms of hiding their own concerns about their loved one, and this process that theyíre going to.  So they also need some support. So some key things to think about, just in general, is having some kind of a structured schedule.  Having a structured schedule in terms of meals, medications, making sure you go to the doctor regularly. And then social activities, making sure that that there is that regular contact with family,  friends, church, whomever, you have some social contact with.  And that really helps in providing a buffer.  And certainly you know whatever cultural background you come from you know those are those cultural activities will also help.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Certain rights can never be deniedÖ</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The rights for a patient in a hospital setting are often, in many cases, the same for an involuntary patient, as they are for voluntary patient. There are certain rights that, by law, can never be denied.  For example, you must be able to be treated with humane care, dignity, and respect. You have a right to religious freedom and practice. You have a right to be free from discrimination.  Those rights can never be denied.  However, there are some rights that are afforded to patients by law that can be denied, if they are being used in a way that is dangerous to others.  These are rights that involve being able to wear your own clothing, being able to receive visitors, being able to use the phone. And there are others as well.  These rights,if they are being used in a way that they are injurious to either the patient or to others on the unit, then it may be that those rights can be denied temporarily.  Additionally, as a patient in a hospital receiving care, the patient has a right to refuse medical treatment, and to refuse psychiatric medication, if the patient does not want to take medication. And there may be a separate hearing that will be held to decide whether or not the patient has the ability to consent or refuse that medication. If the patient has been placed on an involuntary hold, there will be a due process hearing that will be held within a very short time of the hold having been placed.  And, the patient always retains the right to request a writ of habeas corpus and to be able to go downtown and be heard in front of a judge.</Content>

<Content id="0">A hospital is required to start providing discharge planning for a patient in the hospital from the moment the patient arrives. Hopefully by the time the patient has been discharged there are several options and referrals that are being made available to the patient at the time the patient is leaving the hospital.  However, the patient does retain the right, as a free individual, to not follow up on those services.  We would hope, of course, that anyone does follow up on services that are helpful.  If an individual is on a conservatorship, specifically in LPS conservatorship, it may be that some of their rights have temporarily been given to a conservator; rights involving decisions on where the individual can be placed, and rights on what medication the individual must be taking, among others. However, if you are not on LPS conservatorship, an individual is free to go from the hospital and make whatever choices they think are in their best interest.</Content>

<Content id="0">The law allows that certain individuals can be hospitalized against their will if they are meeting certain legal criteria. The three legal criteria are danger to self, danger to others, and grave disability.  All of these criteria need to be due to a mental disorder.  So someone is presenting with certain behaviors that are dangerous to themselves or others, or they are unable to provide for their own basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter, and they are resistant to treatment, they may be brought into a hospital involuntarily.  This may be done by law enforcement who is authorized by law to bring individuals in under whatís called a 5150, or someone whoís in an emergency department or receiving care in a health facility may be placed on involuntary hold and treatment may be provided against the individuals will.  The law always provides for voluntary treatment as preference, and if you are in a facility or loved one is in a facility who wants to be there voluntarily that information should be communicated to treating providers, and or patient advocacy, and all efforts will be made to switch that person to a voluntary status if that applies.</Content>

<Content id="0">If a family member or a client needs to call 911,  the emergency would need to be that of a responsible law enforcement agency. A dispatcher from the agency in which the person is making the call would answer it answer the phone.  And the first few questions that that dispatchers going to need from the person making that 911 call is: your name, what is the emergency, who are you calling about, where is the location, and are there weapons involved.  Once they get these very few first questions completed, they will get officers or a deputy in route if needed and necessary. And, at that point the caller whoís making the 911 call can continue on and request for additional information. If it is a mental health emergency, we encourage a family member or a client to ask for a PERT unit.  Just because theyíre asking for a PERT unit, I want to let our clients and our families know, that they may not necessarily get a PERT unit response.  So when you call 911 we want you to know that first and foremost you will get a law enforcement response, but please ask, if they have a PERT unit available to please send a PERT unit.</Content>

<Content id="0">The Psychiatric Emergency Response Team, better known as PERT here in San Diego, is a team that is made up of a law enforcement officer or deputy and a licensed clinic clinician.  A licensed clinician for PERT can be a registered nurse, a licensed social worker, a licensed marriage family therapist, or licensed psychologist.  The purpose of the PERT program is to pair law enforcement and mental health together in that police car and respond to calls that are a mental health crisis.
The value of having PERT respond to these mental health calls that have come to the attention of law enforcement, is that law enforcement is the agency or the system that responds to the emergency call, but once that scene is safe, we have the opportunity to have a clinician on that scene to help support the officer and more importantly help support the client and the family.  To assess the mental health crisis, to provide referrals, and if necessary to support in a transportation to the most appropriate mental health facility that that client is going to need.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">CliniciansÖmake sure the client is transported to the most appropriate level of care.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A PERT clinician is assigned to a law enforcement officer.  When somebody is having a mental health emergency, whether itís a family member calling on behalf of their loved one, or the client themselves experiencing the mental health emergency,  What happens is that we pick up the phone, we call 911, that goes into a law enforcement system. And so, a dispatcher will receive that phone call and dispatch out an officer or deputy to respond to that mental health crisis.  So, regardless of the mental health emergency, if youíre calling 911 you will get a law enforcement response.  PERT places clinicians with officers and deputies so we can support, not only the law enforcement agency that received the mental health call, the mental health emergency, but we can support the client at the point of contact. Prior to PERT, prior to all the mental health training that PERT has provided to our law enforcement officers and deputies throughout San Diego County, law enforcement was often asked to evaluate the emergency as it was on the scene, and then transport a person to an appropriate facility. Here, when we have a PERT clinician on the scene, that clinician is able to assess, have access, when appropriate, to mental health records, be able to communicate with the client and make sure that that client's wishes and family member's wishes are adhered to, when appropriate, and make sure that the client is transported to the most appropriate level of care.  Hospitalization may not be the appropriate level of care, but PERT can and will access other resources throughout the county, and make sure that that those client's needs are being addressed, that of come to the attention of law enforcement.  So to recap, if you are calling 911, if you are asking for support on a mental health emergency, you will get a law enforcement response. Please ask if a PERT unit is available, and if we have a unit available, we will do our best to also respond to that call.  But you will always get that law enforcement call first, that officer on that scene.</Content>

When the referral is made to the Next Steps program, we would assess them for their needs, including drug and alcohol issues, mental health support, along with benefits and physical health. We would match that particular patient with somebody who has a specialty, in the Next Steps program, to help them, providing support while they're there. We also provide follow-up support for folks when they leave the hospital we help connect them to services in the community that might match their needs.  For instance benefits, or health navigation into the Family Health Centers, physical health care, mental health clinic connection, or drug and alcohol treatment programs.</Content>

Even though they understand the question, they may not be able to give me the answer that helps me understand the way that their feeling and so often times itís good for family members to be present with them, to help kind of decipher whatís going on with this person and how itís different from their baseline in the way that theyíve always been.</Content>
