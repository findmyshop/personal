Welcome to the Targeted Selection interview simulation.  You will be asked to lead an interview with Pat.  I’ll tell you a little bit about Pat and the position he’s interviewing for in a moment, but first, let me explain how this program works.

During this simulation, Pat will give you 6 STARS; some complete, and some not.   Your goal for the exercise is to get two relevant, complete STARs for each of the two targets, Planning and Organizing and Decision Making.  You should collect motivational fit information for each of the two targets as well.
Remember to use your time wisely.  Don’t spend time gathering irrelevant or redundant information.

After you type in a question for the candidate, he will respond to you, and I will also give you some feedback.  Then you will be asked to select what kind of question you want to ask next.  Your options are:

&#8226; Ask a follow up question to complete the STAR
&#8226; Ask a motivational fit question
&#8226; Or, you can move on to another example

Some tips for success:

&#8226; You will be typing in what you would say to Pat directly, so there is no need to start your sentences off with “I would ask Pat” Or “I would tell Pat.”
&#8226; Although building rapport and managing the interview are important skills, this simulation is only evaluating how well you ask behavioral questions and motivational fit questions, so you will only be typing in the questions that you would ask the candidate.
&#8226; Enter focused questions, and only enter one statement at a time.  For example, don't try to ask questions such as "Did you do a lot of decision making and how did you feel about that level of responsibility?"

Ok, now you’re ready to meet Pat. You are interviewing Pat for a management position with your company that requires excellent planning and organizing skills as well as good decision making practices.
Download the interview guide from the Library at the top of this page and take some notes as you interview Pat. That’s a great way to keep track of the information Pat relates, and it’s good practice for conducting interviews in real life.

Let’s get started gathering STARs for Planning and Organizing.

Assume that you’ve opened the interview and completed the Key Background review. I’ll ask the first question; then, after you listen to Pat’s response, you can decide what you want to do next by making the appropriate selection.
Ok, I’m going to start the interview by asking Pat a behavioral question on Planning and Organizing.

Pat, please describe a time when you needed to complete several things at the same time and tell me what you did to get the work done.

Absolutely.  Eight years ago when I was in college I had a pretty heavy work load.   I was taking six different classes at the same time and I was involved in a lot of activities.   I was also working at the local coffee shop ten hours a week.  It was a pretty stressful time.

I was busy with fraternity, and student government and all those time commitments made me consider whether I should change my major or stay in college at all.  I went home and had a good conversation with my parents, and worked it through.  I decided to drop my job at the coffee shop and that really helped.  Sorry if I was rambling, I really couldn’t think of a good example.

You asked for information to complete the STAR, but you asked a question that didn't focus on the Planning and Organizing Key Actions.

Also think about whether the information you’re learning about Pat’s college experience is relevant to the position you’re interviewing him for.  Perhaps he has another example that is more relevant.

Listen to how Pat responds when asked the follow-up question “How did you prioritize all of your tasks?”

I learned to make a schedule for myself and to prioritize my activities.  Obviously, my classes came first, and my job because they were counting on me.  And, I had to learn to say no to some of the extra-curricular activities so that I didn’t take on too much.  I ended up asking for help with some of the fraternity activities I was helping to plan as well.

Remember, when you’re asking a behavioral question, try not to use the words “would” or “could”.  These words prompt theoretical responses in which the candidate tells you what they “would” do in a situation rather than what they have done in the past.

Also, keep in mind that the information you’re getting is from Pat's experience in college, 8 years ago.

Remember that you need two relevant STARs for each target to complete your part of the interview.

Before deciding what to do next, watch Pat’s response when asked the follow-up question "How did you prioritize all of your tasks?”

You’re looking for actual past performance, so try not to ask questions that suggest the answer you're looking for.  Good follow-up questions get the candidate to tell you about specific situations where they have used the skills you're interviewing for.

Also, keep in mind that the information Pat has related is from 8 years ago, and is not really relevant to the job you're interviewing him for.

Remember, you need two relevant STARs for each target to complete your part of the interview.

Motivational fit questions should prompt the candidate to give you more information about the specific aspects of their work that they like or dislike.

Also, consider whether the information you’re getting is relevant to the job you’re interviewing Pat for.  Perhaps he has a more relevant example that he can share.

Before you decide what to do next, listen to how Pat responds when asked a specific question such as "How did you feel about the amount of stress you were under?"

Pat is right, that question was off base.  Beware of questions that touch on potentially personal issues such as the candidate's home life, marital status, or ethnicity.  These may be illegal questions.  Only questions that pertain to the candidate’s qualifications for the job are appropriate.

Research has shown that questions like that are not predictive of on-the-job performance.

In some situations, like when you’re evaluating for specific skills, these types of questions might be appropriate.

Sure.  Well, I had 7 different projects that were all due during the past week.  I was on schedule on 5 of them.  But needed extra time for the other two projects.  So I worked with my manager to prioritize each project and create a schedule to complete them.  I also asked my manager for assistance from other people on the team to help with the projects that were behind schedule.

Pat is right, that question was off base.  Beware of questions that touch on potentially personal issues such as the candidate's home life, marital status, or ethnicity.  These may be illegal questions.  Only questions that pertain to the candidate’s qualifications for the job are appropriate.

Research has shown that questions like that are not predictive of on-the-job performance.

In some situations, like when you’re evaluating for specific skills, these types of questions might be appropriate.

However, in this simulation we are only evaluating behavioral interviewing skills.

Remember, when you’re asking a behavioral question, try not to use words like “would”, or “could.”  These words prompt theoretical STARs in which the candidate tells you what they “would” do in a situation rather than what they have done in the past.

Before selecting what to do next listen to the example Pat gives after being asked the question “Can you tell me about a time when you helped your team get organized?”

Let’s see, about 6 months ago, I thought that our team wasn’t keeping each other aware of the different projects we were working on.  So I set up an online document sharing site and a process to share our project plans and to track our progress.

I presented the idea to my supervisor and she really liked it.  So I shared information about the new process at our team meeting and helped everybody load the appropriate documents onto the online site.  And I helped people as they worked in the site with questions that they had about the process.

After about 2 or 3 weeks everyone had learned the new process and was using it.  I received several compliments from my team members saying how much the new site and process really helped them.

You asked a behavioral question to find out more about Pat’s document sharing site and that’s great, but are you certain you needed to ask a follow up question at all?

Pat related the situation and task, the actions he took and the result of his actions, so that counts as a complete STAR.

As you move through the rest of the interview, pay close attention to exactly what information you’re getting from Pat so that you don’t waste time asking for information you already have.

His STAR was missing the result, so you want to ask a question to uncover what happened as a result of his actions.

To get a meaningful answer you have to ask for specific information.

And, when you’re thinking about what step to take next, remember that you are really interested in Pat’s decision making skills.

Before you move on, listen to what Pat says when asked the question “What did you especially enjoy about your work on this project?”

I enjoyed managing all of the different tasks and coordinating the other volunteers, but I have to say that it required a lot of time on the phone tracking down donors and that part I didn’t enjoy as much.

Motivational fit questions help you to learn more about the candidate’s motivations, so you want to be careful not to assume how the candidate feels about their experience.

Also, think about what the goals of this exercise are and whether Pat’s volunteer experience is giving you the information you need.

 Well, recently we had an unhappy customer who didn’t get the correct materials for an order. So, the decision was made to credit their account, which made the client happy.

However, a few weeks later that customer placed the same incorrect order.  At that point, we realized then that it wasn’t our mistake.

The problem was that the form was confusing and causing the customer to enter their order incorrectly.

Pat has already given you that information, but what he didn’t tell you was the short part of the long story.

Try asking a different follow-up question to get the information you need.

I weighed the pros and cons of the different options and discussed them with the team, but I was the person who picked the option we presented to the client.

You really aren’t looking for guesses; you want to hear how Pat actually handled that specific situation.

Pat could answer that question any number of ways, which might not get you the information you need.

Try asking a more specific question to target Pat’s response and save both of you time.

A question that asks the candidate to tell you how they felt about a particular aspect of their work is going to get you more specific information about what a candidate likes or doesn’t like.

Pat is right, that question was off base.  Beware of questions that touch on potentially personal issues such as the candidate's home life, marital status, or ethnicity.  These may be illegal questions.  Only questions that pertain to the candidate’s qualifications for the job are appropriate.

Research has shown that questions like that are not predictive of on-the-job performance.

In some situations, like when you’re evaluating for specific skills, these types of questions might be appropriate.

However, in this simulation we are only evaluating behavioral interviewing skills.
