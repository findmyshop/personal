<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a clinical trial?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical research is often conducted by means of a "clinical trial" defined by The United States National Institute of Health (NIH) as "one type of clinical research that follows a pre-defined plan or protocol." A clinical trial is scientifically controlled study of the safety and effectiveness of investigational treatments and devices for various diseases and conditions. These trials determine if treatments are safe to use and will improve the health of people. Before a medication, therapy, or medical device can be made available to the general public, it has to go through several phases of clinical research. There are also observational studies, in which people who have a certain condition or disease or who receive a particular treatment are followed, or observed, over time and compared with another group of people who are not affected by the condition.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the phases of a clinical trial?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical trials are typically performed in "phases." These phases are designed to build evidence that an investigational treatment will be beneficial to patients with a particular disease or condition.Before a medication can be tested in human subjects, pre-clinical testing occurs in a lab environment to gather data on whether the investigational treatment has the potential to work in treating the disease. Next, the therapy transitions to a Phase I clinical trial, which typically involves a small number of healthy patients and is designed to test whether the experimental treatment is safe and to determine what dose should be given. If the results show that the treatment is safe, it will transition into Phase II clinical trials, where it will be tested in patients with the disease or condition to see whether the treatment has any effect on this disease. The overall safety of the drug will also continue to be assessed. If the therapy works to treat a disease, it will enter Phase III trials, which involve a large number of patients to assess the effectiveness of the new treatment and how it compares to existing therapies, if applicable. And again, the overall safety of the drug will continue to be assessed.Often times, more than one trial will be conducted in Phase II and Phase III, although this is not always the case.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the types of clinical trials?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are two main types of clinical trials: Placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials.A placebo-controlled trial means that one group of patients will receive the treatment to be evaluated, while a second group, often known as the control group, will receive a placebo treatment. This placebo often looks just like the experimental treatment but is designed to have no real effect on patients. Placebos are often used in blinded trials, which are trials where the patients do not know whether they are receiving the real or placebo treatment; this is done to account for the "placebo effect," which is what the effect of participation in the study that does not result from the therapy itself is called.It's also important to note that placebo trials are usually, but not always, done where no standard of care or FDA-approved treatment exists.In a head-to-head or comparative effectiveness trial, one group of patients receives the treatment to be evaluated, while a second group of patients receives a different therapy. In most cases, the other therapy, or comparator, is a treatment that is already commonly used by patients. This is often referred to as the "standard of care." These types of trials allow researchers to see how the experimental therapy performs in comparison to other therapies.When discussing clinical trials, you might notice that they can also be referred to as "single-blind" or "double-blind." A single-blind trial means that the investigators involved in the trial know whether the patient is getting the investigational treatment, but the patient is not aware. In a double-blind trial, neither the investigator nor the patient knows who is receiving the investigational therapy. By "blinding" the trials, no biases--whether real or unintentional--are introduced into the trial.</Content>

<Content id="0">A Data Safety and Monitoring Committee, sometimes known as a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, is an independent group of experts who monitor patient safety and treatment efficacy data during the course of a clinical trial. The group, which typically includes 3 to 10 members, is authorized to recommend that a trial be stopped due to safety concerns, because the treatment is not effective, or if the new treatment is so beneficial that it should be immediately considered for approval. Members of the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee are not related to the institution or company conducting or sponsoring the trial and are usually made up of clinicians with knowledge of the disease or condition being treated, statisticians, and sometimes a patient advocacy representative.</Content>

<Content id="0">The nature of participating in a clinical trial means that you may receive an investigational treatment, which could be observed by some as making you a "guinea pig." However, all procedures and tests performed prior to participation, during participation, and after participation ends are clearly outlined in the clinical trial protocol and are subject to ethical guidelines, which include that the study is designed in a way so as to answer a specific scientific question. Therefore, unnecessary experiments or those that are not aimed at answering the pre-determined scientific question cannot be performed.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Are placebos ethical?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Patients participating in a placebo-controlled clinical trial are told during the informed-consent process that there is a chance that they could receive the investigational treatment or an inactive placebo while participating in the study. A placebo often looks like the investigational medication, but it has no active ingredient in it. Placebos are used in clinical research to help evaluate the effectiveness of an investigational medication. Because some participants receive the inactive placebo, the researchers can see the affect the investigational medication has in those who take it. Using a placebo during a study is ethical because the patient has been informed that there is a possibility that they will be receiving no treatment. It is also important to note that depending on the disease, an approved standard of care therapy may not exist. Therefore, if you are participating in a study that has a placebo, the placebo may actually be the standard of care.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is informed consent?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that potential study participants be given complete information about the planned trial under a process known as "informed consent." This process is designed to accurately inform individuals of the purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to the clinical trial; ensure that participants understand this information and how it relates to their own health or interests; and provides an opportunity for an individual to make a voluntary decision about whether to participate in the study.Once you have had enough time to read and understand the informed consent form and had time to discuss with the study doctor, you can choose to participate in the trial by signing a written informed consent form. Even if you sign the form, you can still withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason.</Content>

<Content id="0">If you participate in a clinical trial, you are guaranteed certain right that may be referred to as a "Bill of Rights." Taking part in a clinical trial is your decision, and it affords you certain rights. For example, the Clinical Trial Volunteer's Bill of Rights states that you be given enough time to decide whether to participate and to make that decision without any pressure from the people who are doing the research; that you can refuse to participate in the study and to stop participating at any time; and that your decision not to participate will not affect your right to your usual care not related to the research. In addition, this bill of rights states that you have the right to be told why the clinical trial is being done, what will happen, and what you will be asked to do if you are in the trial, as well as to be informed of any reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, or side effects that may occur during the trial and who will pay for any research-related treatment. This bill of rights also empowers you to have your questions answered by the research team at any time and requires that you receive a copy of your signed Informed Consent form.</Content>

<Content id="0">The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an investigational medication called tolvaptan in patients with late stage 2 to early stage 4 chronic kidney disease caused by autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, or ADPKD. For people with ADPKD, the kidneys respond abnormally to the hormone vasopressin, which may be involved in cyst development or growth in humans. The investigational medication is designed to interfere with or block the effect of vasopressin on the kidneys. The purpose of this trial is to test how useful tolvaptan will be in treating ADPKD. You are being asked to take part in this study because you have been diagnosed with late stage 2 and to early stage 4 chronic kidney disease caused by ADPKD.</Content>

<Content id="0">Although tolvaptan is still considered experimental in the treatment of ADPKD, it was approved in the United States in 2009 for the treatment of patients with certain types of hyponatremia, which is a low amount of sodium or salt in the blood. Tolvaptan was also approved in Europe in 2009 for hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, or SIADH. It was also recently approved in Japan for the treatment of ADPKD and is now being studied in several other countries in the REPRISE study as a potential treatment for ADPKD.</Content>

For the REPRISE study, it is very important that the researchers be able to follow your progress and health even if you do not want to continue taking the investigational medication. If you wish to stop taking the investigational medication, the study doctor will ask you a series of questions, including whether you would be willing to continue to participate in the study tests and procedures that would normally be done during the remaining planned course of the study. You will not be considered fully withdrawn from the study (i.e. you will not be asked to take the study medication, you will not participate in study procedures, you will not participate in study follow activities) unless you answer "No" to all of the questions.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What will the treatment entail? Administration method? Dose?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">For the majority of the time you are participating in the study, you will be randomly assigned to receive either tolvaptan or placebo. "Randomly assigned" means that you will be assigned by chance, like the toss of a coin, to receive either tolvaptan or placebo. Your chance of receiving either tolvaptan or placebo is 50 percent. Once you have been randomly assigned to treatment, neither you, your study doctor, nor Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development and Commercialization, Inc. will know if you are taking tolvaptan or placebo Both tolvaptan and placebo are an oral tablet that is self-administered once upon wakening and again approximately 8 to 9 hours later. During a small portion of the treatment period, you will be exposed to tolvaptan and placebo and may be switched back and forth between treatments at different times for defined intervals. You will also go through a short phase where you will be given gradually increasing doses of the investigational medication but you will not be told whether it is tolvaptan or placebo. The study doctor may adjust the dosage over the course of the treatment period based on your reaction to tolvaptan or placebo.</Content>

<Content id="0">In total, the study will last approximately 15 months from start to finish. You will enter a 1- to 2- week screening period where study staff will determine whether you meet the qualifications to enroll in the trial. The screening period may be extended up to an additional 8 weeks if needed to allow you to adjust to changes made in certain medications or to repeat certain blood tests. Once you have successfully enrolled in the trial, you will enter the treatment period of the study and will be given either placebo or tolvaptan during the next 13 to 14 months. Finally, once you have stopped taking the study medication you will enter the follow-up period, which will last for 3 weeks.</Content>

<Content id="0">Over the course of the clinical trial, you will continue to be treated by your regular doctor. This doctor will be in charge of providing all non-study related care, including care for any existing or new medical problems. It is important that you discuss any existing medical conditions with your research team so that they have a complete picture of your health ahead of the study, including any other medications or treatments that you may use. Tolvaptan is not a substitute for any of your current treatments. Tolvaptan will not replace any of your medications; however, the use of some medications is restricted during the study. Your study doctor will ask you about the medications you are currently taking and will tell you if any of them cannot be taken during the study. Otherwise, you will continue taking your other usual medication as prescribed by your doctor. If your personal physician prescribes any other medication while you are in this study, you must first consult your study doctor prior to taking them. Tell your doctor about any other medications you are taking since taking tolvaptan, as this may alter how well your medication works. In some cases, your doctor may need to adjust your medication or monitor blood levels of your medication more often to ensure that the medication is working properly. In the event that a new medical problem arises over the course of the study period, please inform both your existing physician and study physician so that they can best coordinate your care.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Will I have to switch doctors if I enroll in a trial?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Because your research team will be focused on providing care related only to the clinical trial, it is important for you to keep seeing your regular physician. There is no reason why you would need to switch doctors because the care that he or she will provide will be different from the care that is provided by the research physician and staff.</Content>

<Content id="0">It is recommended that you let your regular doctor know about your decision to participate in a clinical trial. Your doctor knows you and your health history, which makes him or her a good resource to discuss whether participating in a clinical trial might be right for you. In addition, your participation in a clinical trial may mean that you will take a different medication or undergo testing that may alter the way in which he or she approaches your treatment.</Content>
