<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a clinical study?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical research studies are often conducted by means of a clinical study. The United States National Institutes of Health defines a clinical study as "one type of clinical research that follows a pre-defined plan or protocol." A clinical study is a scientifically controlled study of the safety and effectiveness of investigational drugs and devices for various diseases and conditions. These studies determine if these investigational drugs or devices are safe to use and will improve the health of people. Before a medication, therapy, or medical device can be made available to the general public, it has to go through several phases of clinical research.</Content>

<Content id="0">Clinical studies in the United States are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, often referred to as the FDA.The FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the regulation and supervision of medications, foods, medical devices, and other products. One role of the FDA is to ensure adherence to laws that are consistent with principles known as good clinical practices, or GCPs.These principles are designed to enhance the quality of clinical study data, as well as to ensure the protection of study participants like you.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the phases of a clinical trial?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical studies are typically performed in "phases." These phases are designed to build evidence that an investigational drug or device will be beneficial to patients with a particular disease or condition. Before a medication can be tested in human subjects, pre-clinical testing occurs in a lab environment that may involve animals. The goal is to gather data on whether the investigational drug or device has the potential to work in treating the disease.Before a medication moves to testing in humans, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, reviews pre-clinical testing results to determine if the investigational compound can further be studied in humans. If the investigational compound can be studied in humans, that research is divided into different phases. In Phase I, researchers test an investigational medication in a small group of people to evaluate its safety and identify side effects. Often, healthy volunteers are used as participants.In Phase II, the investigational medication is given to a larger group of people to see if it is effective, determine optimal dosage, and to further evaluate safety.In Phase III, the investigational medication is given to a large group of people to confirm effectiveness, monitor side effects, and compare it to existing treatments.In Phase IV studies, the medication is further studied after it has been approved for sale by relevant regulatory authorities. Further information is gathered on the medication's effect on different populations and its long-term side effects.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the types of clinical trials?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are two main types of clinical studies: Placebo-controlled and head-to-head studies. A placebo-controlled study means that one group of patients will receive the investigational drug to be evaluated, while a second group, often known as the control group, will receive a placebo. This placebo often looks just like the experimental drug but is designed to have no effect on patients.Placebos are often used in blinded studies, which are studies where the patients do not know whether the are receiving the experimental drug or placebo. Blinding is used to help eliminate the "placebo effect," which is bias introduced into the study. Bias may result from a patient's belief that he or she is receiving a certain treatment or the researcher's belief that a certain result will occur.In a head-to-head or comparative effectiveness study, one group of patients receives the investigational drug to be evaluated, while a second group of patients receives a different therapy. This allows researchers to see how the experimental treatment performs in comparison to other therapies. In a head-to-head study there is no placebo, and the patient has a chance of receiving either the investigational drug or another treatment. In most cases, the other treatment, also called a comparator or reference treatment is already commonly prescribed by doctors for patients with the disease that is being investigated in the study. The reference treatment is often referred to as the "standard of care."</Content>

<Content id="0">A Data Safety and Monitoring Committee, sometimes known as a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, is an independent group of experts who monitor patient safety and treatment effectiveness data during the course of a clinical study.This group typically includes 3 to 10 members and is authorized to recommend that a study be stopped due to safety concerns. This may occur after the group reviews a subset of the data from the study that shows the study treatment is not effective or if the investigational treatment is so beneficial that it should urgently be considered for approval by the regulatory authorities.Members of the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee are independent from anyone involved in the study.The committee is usually made up of expert clinicians with knowledge of the disease or condition being treated, statisticians, and sometimes a patient advocacy representative.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is randomization?/Why is a study randomized?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Randomization in a clinical study is when participants are assigned to a particular group and the different groups receive different study treatments. Clinical studies are randomized so that the researchers can compare the safety and effectiveness of different study treatments. Sometimes, investigational medications are compared to a placebo, which looks like the investigational medication but contains no active ingredients.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is informed consent?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Laws and ethical guidelines governing clinical research in many countries around the world require that potential study participants be given certain information about the planned study through a process known as "informed consent." This process is designed to accurately inform individuals of the purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to the clinical study. The informed consent process also ensures that participants understand information about the study and how it relates to their own health or interests. It also provides an opportunity for an individual to make a voluntary decision about whether to participate in the study. Once you have had enough time to read and understand the informed consent form and had time to discuss it with the study doctor, you can determine if you wish to participate in the study. If you choose to participate, you will sign the informed consent form. Even if you sign the form, you can still withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason.</Content>

<Content id="0">Taking part in a clinical study is your decision, and you keep all of your rights. For example, you are to be given enough time to decide whether to participate and to make that decision without any pressure from the people who are doing the clinical research. You can also refuse to participate in the study or stop participating at any time. Your decision not to participate will not affect your right to your usual care that is unrelated to the research study. In addition, you have the right to be told why the clinical study is being done, what will happen, and what you will be asked to do if you are in the study. You will also be informed of any reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, or side effects that may occur during the study and who will pay for any treatment related to the clinical research. You have the right to have your questions answered by the clinical research team at any time and receive a copy of your signed informed consent form.</Content>

<Content id="0">Rheumatoid arthritis causes pain, inflammation, and eventually joint damage and malformation. It can cause people to feel sick, tired, and feverish; it also affects joints symmetrically, so that joint pain is felt on both sides of the body. RA is also associated with a higher risk of infections; cardiovascular disease, especially ischemic heart disease; and mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression.</Content>

<Content id="0">There is currently no cure for rheumatoid arthritis; however, medications do exist to help limit pain, increase joint function, and slow down the long-term worsening of the condition. Current treatments for rheumatoid arthritis typically include a combination of medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also called NSAIDs, that reduce pain, swelling, and stiffness, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, also called DMARDs, that help limit the activity of the body's immune system. Aspirin and ibuprofen are examples of commonly used NSAIDs. Methotrexate is an example of a DMARD.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Should I continue to see my regular doctor for other medical problems during this study?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Over the course of the clinical study, you should continue to be treated by your regular doctor. This doctor will be in charge of providing all non-study related care. It is important that you discuss any existing medical conditions with the study doctor or study staff so that they have a complete picture of your health, including any other medications or treatments that you may use. The investigational medication is not a substitute for any of your current treatments. It will not replace any of your medications; however, the use of some medications is restricted during the study. The study doctor will ask you about the medications you are currently taking and will tell you if any of them cannot be taken during the study. If your regular physician prescribes any other medications while you are in this study, you must first consult the study doctor prior to taking them. Tell the study doctor about any other medications you take after beginning the study, as the investigational medication may alter how well other medications work. In the event that a new medical problem arises over the course of the study, please inform both your regular doctor and the study doctor so that they can best coordinate your care.</Content>
