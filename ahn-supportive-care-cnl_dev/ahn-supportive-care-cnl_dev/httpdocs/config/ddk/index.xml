<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a clinical trial?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A clinical trial is a study performed to test investigational medications, vaccines, or devices for various diseases and conditions. These studies determine if the investigational medication works and is safe to use. Before an investigational medication, or medical device can be made available to the general public, it has to go through several phases of clinical research.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Who regulates clinical trials?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical trials are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, known as the FDA in the United States. The FDA ensures the study team follows a set of principles known as good clinical practices, or GCPs. These principles are designed to make sure the study participants are protected and the study team gets information from the clinical trial that they can potentially use to develop future treatment options.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the phases of a clinical trial?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical trials are typically performed in "phases." Before an investigational medication can be tested in human subjects, testing occurs in a lab to gather data on whether the investigational medication may work for the disease. Next, the investigational medication transitions to something called a Phase I clinical trial, which typically involves a small number of healthy subjects and is designed to test whether the investigational treatment is safe and to determine what dose should be given. If the results show that the investigational medication is safe, it will move into Phase II clinical trials, where it will be tested in patients with the disease or condition to see whether the investigational medication has any effect on the disease. If the investigational medication works to treat a disease, it will enter Phase III trials, which involve a large number of patients to see if it is safe and effective.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the types of clinical trials?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are two main types of clinical trials: Placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials. A placebo-controlled trial means that one group of patients will receive the investigational medication, while a second group, often known as the control group, will receive something called a placebo. Placebo often looks just like the investigational medication but is designed to have no effect on patients. In a head-to-head trial, one group of patients receives the investigational medication to be evaluated, while a second group of patients receives a different study medication. In most cases, the other study medication is a treatment that is already commonly used by patients. This is often referred to as the standard of care. These types of trials allow researchers to see how the investigational medication performs compared to approved treatments.</Content>

<Content id="0">In order to conduct a clinical trial, the study team must agree to comply with ethical guidelines designed to protect the physical and mental health of participants, as well as to preserve the integrity of the research. These ethical guidelines ensure that people are treated with respect from the time that they are approached for possible participation in the study, during their participation, and after their participation ends. These guidelines also protect a participant's right to privacy and the right for a participant to change his or her mind about being in the trial at any point without losing any benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Are placebos ethical?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Using a placebo during a study is ethical because patients participating in a study with placebo are told during the informed consent process that there is a chance that they could receive the investigational medication or a placebo. Placebos are used in clinical research to help evaluate the effectiveness of an investigational medication. Because some participants receive the placebo, the researchers can see the effects the investigational medication has on those who take it.</Content>

<Content id="0">The study team is required to tell the truth about all parts of a clinical trial, including the potential risks, benefits, and available alternatives associated with the specific study. However, in blinded studies, researchers will not be able to tell participants which investigational medication they are receiving because it is important for the study that neither the patient nor the doctor know if the patient is receiving the investigational medication.</Content>

Your doctor knows your health history, which makes him or her a good resource to discuss whether participating in a clinical study might be right for you. In addition, your participation in a clinical study may mean that you will take a different medication or undergo testing that may impact the way in which your regular doctor approaches your treatment. Your doctor should talk to the study doctor, especially if he or she wants to perform tests to assess the same disease that is being evaluated in the study.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is informed consent?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that potential study participants be given complete information about the planned trial under a process known as "informed consent." This process is designed to clearly inform individuals of information about the study including the purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to the clinical trial. Following this discussion, you can choose to participate in the trial by signing an informed consent form. Even if you sign the form, you can still withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What rights do I have if I participate in a clinical trial?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">All clinical trial participants are granted certain rights. You have the right to be given enough time to decide whether to participate and to make that decision without any pressure from the people who are doing the research. You also have the right to refuse to participate in the study and stop participating at any time. If you decide not to participate, this will not affect the right you have to receive medical care not related to the research. In addition, you have the right to be told why the clinical trial is being done, what will happen, and what you will be asked to do if you are in the trial. You'll also be informed of any reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, or side effects that may occur during the trial and who will pay for any study-related treatment. And finally, you have the right to have your questions answered by the study team at any time and to receive a copy of the signed informed consent form.</Content>

Neither you nor your doctor will know to which group you have been assigned. If you are eligible and agree to participate in the study, you will be required to attend up to 10 study visits over 33 weeks. You will also be expected to monitor your blood sugar levels with a glucometer and maintain a study diary with information about your health. If you use insulin, you will have to record when you take insulin in this diary.</Content>
