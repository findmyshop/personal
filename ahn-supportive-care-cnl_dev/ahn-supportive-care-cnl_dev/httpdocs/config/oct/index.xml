<BaseQuestion id="0">Oral Cancer Drug Overview</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Welcome to our guide on oral cancer drugs.  When people think of chemotherapy, they usually think of going to a hospital or clinic and being connected to an intravenous or I-V drip or getting an injection. But now, more and more cancer patients are being treated with oral chemotherapy drugs -- cancer medications that you take by mouth, just like most other medications.

These oral cancer drugs have many benefits.  Although just as powerful, oral cancer drugs don't require needles like IV cancer medications or injections.  And, they can be taken at home, so there is less time spent traveling to and from clinics.

So, rather than having a healthcare provider give you the medications in a clinic, you will be taking these medications yourself and will have to follow the directions for taking them very carefully. These drugs are not just ordinary pills. They are powerful medications.  Oral cancer drugs require special handling and it's important that you understand your medications so you can follow your treatment plan, manage any side effects and report them to your healthcare provider when necessary.

That's why we're here today, to help you learn about your oral cancer drugs so that you can get the most out of your treatment while keeping yourself and your loved ones safe.

Are you ready to get started?</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Six Important Facts about Oral Cancer Drugs</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Okay, here are 6 very important things you should know about oral cancer drugs:
First, oral cancer drugs are just as strong and just as effective as the I-V or injected drugs you would get at a clinic or hospital.

Second, because they are such powerful drugs, it is very important that you take your medication exactly as prescribed. If you don't, your treatment may not be as effective and you may have worse side effects than expected. We'll talk about some important tips to help you stay on track with your medication so you get the best treatment possible.

Third, almost all patients on oral cancer drugs will have side effects. It is important that the side effects be managed, not only because they can affect your quality of life, but also because they can interfere with your treatment. Do not take any physical symptoms you may have lightly. Side effects need to be reported to your healthcare provider because they can be serious and even life threatening. In this program, we'll talk about the most common side effects, give you guidance on how to manage them, and discuss when to call your healthcare provider or when to get emergency help.

Fourth, oral cancer drugs can be harmful if they are not properly handled. People who have cancer and are taking these drugs should know what steps to take to keep themselves and their loved ones safe. People who don't have cancer need to avoid coming in contact with the drugs and the body fluids of people taking the drugs. Oral cancer medications should always be kept away from children and pets, and pregnant women should not handle them. We'll go over the necessary precautions you need to take to keep everyone safe.

Fifth, like many other medications, oral cancer drugs can have drug and food interactions so we'll talk about how to find out what medications or foods you should avoid.

And lastly, in the past, you would see your healthcare team every time you received medication; but now, because you're taking oral cancer drugs at home, it's important to stay in touch with your healthcare team on a regular basis to let them know how you're doing. Always call your healthcare team if you have a fever over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, or if you have trouble breathing, bloody stool, chest pain, or are vomiting despite taking anti-nausea medications.

This might seem a little overwhelming, there is a lot to learn. This program is designed so that you can find the information you need right now, then come back again later to learn more. You can ask your own questions at any time just by typing them in.  Or you can use the links to the left to explore the topics that you're interested in. When you ask a question, we'll suggest other topics you might find interesting, in the Related Questions area to the right.  During the program, we'll refer to additional links and documents that will be listed in the Resources Area at the top of the page.

Remember, you are not alone. On this site we are giving you the tools and guidance to help you follow your treatment plan safely and effectively, so that you get the best treatment possible for your cancer. We have answered some of the most common questions in this program, but remember, it is important that you call your healthcare provider if you have any other questions or if something is not clear to you.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are oral cancer drugs?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">An oral cancer drug is any medication taken by mouth to treat cancer. It can be a tablet, liquid or capsule. These cancer drugs are sometimes referred to as oral chemotherapy, but there are several types of drugs used to treat cancer that now come in oral form. Oral cancer drugs can be broken down into three main types: One of those types is cytotoxic, or what people commonly refer to as chemotherapy or chemo. The other types are targeted therapies, and hormonal agents.

For more information on each type of medication, look in the related questions area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is cytotoxic chemotherapy?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Cytotoxic chemotherapy, often just called chemo, goes through your whole body to kill cancer cells. It generally works by keeping the cancer cells from dividing and forming new cells.  Most chemotherapy drugs also keep normal, healthy cells from dividing, and this is what causes some of the side effects.  Cells that normally divide quickly, such as the hair follicles, reproductive tract, digestive tract, and bone marrow cells are the most affected.

Some common side effects of oral chemotherapy are:
&#8226; Bone marrow suppression, which can make you more likely to get infections or increase your risk of bleeding
&#8226; Anemia, or low red blood cells, which can make you tired and short of breath
&#8226; Gastrointestinal problems including mouth sores, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
&#8226; Peripheral neuropathy, which is nerve pain or loss of sensation in your hands and feet
&#8226; Hair loss also called alopecia
&#8226; Problems with your vision
&#8226; And confusion and memory problems

For more information on these and other side effects, look in the related questions area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are targeted cancer therapies?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Targeted therapy is used to keep cancer from growing and spreading. These drugs target specific parts of cancer cells to keep them from developing into tumors.  They also work to shrink existing tumors.

Targeted therapies work in several different ways.  Some block the action of enzymes, proteins, and other molecules involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells. Others help your immune system attack and kill cancer cells; and a third kind of targeted therapy poisons cancer cells directly, without affecting healthy cells. Because of the specific ways targeted therapies work, their side effects can be different from those caused by other chemotherapy drugs.

Some common side effects of targeted therapies are:
&#8226; Diarrhea
&#8226; Liver problems such as hepatitis
&#8226; Skin problems such as rashes
&#8226; Problems with blood clotting and wound healing
&#8226; High blood pressure
&#8226; Nausea and vomiting
&#8226; Fatigue
&#8226; Hand-foot syndrome which is redness, swelling, and pain like pins and needles on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet.
&#8226; Damage to the heart
&#8226; And bone marrow suppression which can make you more likely to get an infection, cause shortness of breath or problems with stopping bleeding.

Targeted therapies also have the potential for many dangerous drug interactions.  It is important to tell your healthcare providers about all medications and supplements you are taking.  Make sure that you list everything; including over the counter pain relievers, cold and allergy medicines, skin creams and patches, eye drops, vitamins and holistic medications.  Also, if another healthcare provider prescribes any new medications for you, make sure to check and see that there are no interactions with the cancer medications you are taking.

Information on drug interactions for specific medications can be found in the Food and Drug Administration information that comes with your prescription. You can also find a link to a drug interaction tool in the Resources Area, or you can ask your pharmacist about the specific medications you're taking.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are hormone therapies?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Hormone therapies slow or stop the growth of cancers that need hormones to grow.  These cancer drugs can work in two different ways. They can either prevent the body from producing the hormones that cause cancer growth, or they can stop the hormones from reaching the cancer cells. Known hormone dependent cancers include breast, prostate, endometrial, kidney and ovarian.

The side effects from hormone therapy depend on the type of drug you receive, and side effects can be different for women and men.

Common side effects include:
&#8226; Hot flashes
&#8226; Loss of interest in or ability to have sex
&#8226; Insomnia or the inability to fall or stay asleep
&#8226; Joint pain
&#8226; And weakening of bones

Men taking hormone therapy drugs may also experience:
&#8226; Impotence, or inability to get and keep an erection
&#8226; Shrinking of the testicles
&#8226; And development of opposite sex characteristics such as enlarged breast tissue</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Where will I get my oral cancer drugs?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Your healthcare provider will prescribe the medication that is most effective for your type of cancer.  You may be able to get your medications right at your doctor's office or through the hospital pharmacy.  At these locations there may be staff specially trained in oral cancer medications that can help educate you and answer any questions you have about your prescriptions.

If you are not able to get your oral cancer drugs from your healthcare provider or hospital, you can get your prescription filled at a pharmacy.  Unfortunately, many local and chain pharmacies won't be able to fill your prescription for oral cancer drugs, and may not know the ins and outs of billing for these medications, especially if you are on Medicare Part B.

Instead, you may use a specialty pharmacy.  Prescriptions filled at specialty pharmacies may be sent directly to you through the mail. These pharmacies often work closely with Medicare and insurance plans, so they are usually familiar with billing and co-payments.  And, they may also have specially trained staff to provide instructions and information by phone or mail. Your healthcare provider or insurance provider should be able to help you find a specialty pharmacy.

Before filling your prescription, it may be a good idea to check with your healthcare plan to make sure your cancer meds are covered, and to find out if your health plan requires you to use a specific pharmacy.

Make sure to order refills when you have one to two weeks of pills left so you don't run out.  And, if you are going away, make sure to have enough medication to take with you.

There is more information on pharmacies and insurance in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why are co-payments for oral cancer drugs so high?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Cancer drugs taken by mouth can be very expensive because most health insurance plans do not pay for oral cancer drugs the same way as they pay for I-V cancer drugs.

Health care plans usually cover I-V cancer treatments as a medical benefit because they are given in a hospital or doctor's office. You usually pay only a minimal co-pay or nothing at all for that medication.

However, oral cancer drugs usually come under a health plan's pharmacy benefit, and are treated like any other prescription drug.  This can mean larger co-pays.

Many states have passed laws, called parity laws, which make oral cancer drugs more affordable for patients. These laws require health plans to make out-of-pocket costs the same, regardless of how your cancer treatment is given.  However, these laws do not apply to Medicare.

To find out if your state has passed this law or for more information on this issue check out the links in the Resources Area.

If you have trouble paying for your oral cancer medication there may be help. Many drug manufacturers will help you pay for their drugs. Also, talk with your healthcare team for other resources that may be able to help you pay for your oral cancer medications.

If you would like more information about help with paying for oral cancer drugs or insurance issues, look in the Resources Area.</Content>

<Content id="0">Cancer medications taken by mouth are just as strong as other kinds of chemotherapy and they are just as effective when taken as directed. However, if the treatment plan isn't followed carefully and you take either too little or too much of your medication, your treatment will not be as effective.  You could also have worse side effects if you don't get the correct dose of medication.</Content>

<Content id="0">There can be several medications used to treat any type of cancer. Each drug attacks cancer cells in a different way. Cancer drugs are often used in combination. Sometimes another drug is given to help the chemo work better, or to prevent or control possible side effects. This is sometimes called combination therapy. </Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How does the doctor calculate my dose?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Your doctor will match your dose to your type of cancer and the stage of your cancer.  They may adjust your dose depending on your height and weight.  Your dose may also be adjusted if you are older or if you have other health conditions.

Your dose is calculated just for you, so it is important to take your medications exactly as instructed.  Taking more medication than prescribed can be dangerous and cause life threatening side effects.  Taking less medication than prescribed is just as dangerous and could even make the medication not work as well. This is why it is very important that you tell your healthcare team about anything that interferes with your ability to take your oral cancer drugs as prescribed.  You must get the right dose of medication that treats your cancer with the fewest side effects possible.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What do I need to know about my medication?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Getting a cancer diagnosis can send you into a whirlwind of emotions. While you are still reeling from the news, you are bombarded with tests, information and treatment options. Sometimes it's hard to remember what you've been told, but it is important to know as much about your medication as possible.  It may help to write down a list of questions to ask your healthcare provider.

Here are some things you should know about your medication:
&#8226; The name and spelling of your drug
&#8226; The reason you are taking it
&#8226; How it works
&#8226; What the dose is
&#8226; What time you should take it and how often
&#8226; How many days or months you may need to continue taking the medication
&#8226; What to do if you miss a dose or take too much
&#8226; And whether to take it with or without food or water
&#8226; You should know what foods, drinks or activities should be avoided while taking your medication
&#8226; And whether there are there any other drugs, prescription or over-the-counter, that you should avoid
&#8226; You should also find out how to properly dispose of left over medication.

You can go to the Resources Area to print out this list and take it with you to your doctor's visit. It's important that you keep in touch with your healthcare team and ask them any questions you have about your medication or treatment plan. Also, every time you start a new medication or get a refill from the pharmacy, you should double check the name on the pill bottle to make sure it is your medication; and the name and spelling of the drug, to make sure it is the correct medication.

You should always read the Food and Drug Administration insert that comes with your cancer medication. It will tell you about any possible food or drug interactions.  There is also a link to drug interaction tool in Resources Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I follow my treatment plan?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Oral cancer drugs are often targeted to treat specific types of cancer and your doctor has created a treatment plan just for you that details when and how to take your medications. You must take your medications at specific times, and in a specific way, in order for them to be most effective.  Not taking oral cancer drugs as prescribed can lead to more serious side effects and could affect how well your cancer responds to treatment.

Although treatment plans can seem complex and confusing, we have tools to help you manage your cancer treatment as safely and successfully as possible. You may have problems that make it difficult to stick with your treatment plan at times.  We've provided answers for the most common questions here, but if you have any questions at all about your treatment, drugs or side effects that we don't have an answer for, or if you're still unsure about something, talk to your healthcare team as soon as possible.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why must I take my oral cancer drugs exactly as prescribed?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Oral cancer doses are set up so a patient has a constant level of the drugs in the body to kill cancer cells. This means even a tiny increase or decrease in the dose can be harmful. If the treatment plan isn't followed, your treatment may not be as effective.  It can also lead to additional and possibly severe side effects. You should never crush, split or chew oral cancer pills because it can affect how quickly medication dissolves and can impact how well the drug works. Also, more is not better when it comes to oral cancer drugs. Do not take more than the prescribed dose.  It can cause dangerous side effects. </Content>

<Content id="0">If you miss a dose or throw up after taking your pill, call your healthcare team to find out when you should take the next dose. Never take a dose that's more than what is prescribed, unless your healthcare provider has told you to do so.  For most oral cancer drugs to be effective there needs to be a constant level of the drug in the body.  Not taking cancer drugs as instructed can affect how well the treatment works and can make side effects worse.</Content>

<Content id="0">Your drug treatment plan is designed for you and your specific type of cancer. Sometimes the instructions may seem confusing, but it is important to take your medications exactly as prescribed.  Not taking them properly can cause side effects and could affect how well the drug works.  Making a plan and establishing a routine often helps people keep on track. There are many tools to help you, from smartphone apps to old fashion diaries. It doesn't matter what you use, as long as you use it consistently.

If you have a smartphone or tablet, go to the app store and search for pill reminders. You will see a large list of apps. Check them out to see which one will work the best for you. Look for one that can be personalized to your lifestyle and is easy to use. Some apps have an actual picture of the drug you are taking and will automatically send you text reminders to take your meds. Electronic medication reminders are also available. These are basically pillboxes with alarms to remind you when it is time to take your meds. There are basic, affordable models as well as more advanced and expensive models.

If you don't want to deal with computers or electronics, you can use a paper calendar or pill diary. Keep the calendar in a location that you see daily and mark down when you take your pills.

<Content id="0">Everyone reacts differently to a cancer diagnosis and treatment. Your emotions and mood can change from day to day, even from hour to hour. Cancer can be very unpredictable and you may have good days and bad days. There may be times when uncertainty and fear causes you to feel angry, depressed, or withdrawn. Remember this is normal. Some people find helpful to seek our support groups or a mental health professional to deal with changes in their lives and help them in coping with their diagnosis. Talk to your healthcare team about these feelings. They should be able to advise you on how to find help.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I deal with stress?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Everything about cancer is stressful, but knowing when your stress level is too high and becoming serious is important.

Some signs to look out for are:

&#8226; 	You have feelings of being overwhelmed to the point of panic
&#8226; 	You have trouble concentrating.
&#8226; 	You feel so irritable that it is hard to be around other people, even people you care about, or if others find it hard to be around you.
&#8226; 	You feel unable to cope with pain, tiredness, and nausea

Other signs that your stress levels are too high are:
&#8226; 	You have trouble getting to sleep, staying asleep, or are getting less than 4 hours of sleep a night
&#8226; 	You have trouble eating for a few weeks
&#8226; 	You have lost  interest in activities that are usually pleasurable
&#8226; 	Or you feel a loss of control or loss of confidence

Talk to your healthcare team if you have any of these symptoms. There is a tool, much like a pain scale, that you can use to help measure your stress level.   For more on this screening tool, check out the Resources Area on this page.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Which foods should I avoid?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Some foods can cause problems when taken with oral cancer drugs. It is important to know what foods you can and cannot eat. For instance, there is a substance in some juices that can change how some cancer drugs are absorbed by the body.  This can affect how the drug works, making it stronger or weaker. Grapefruit and its juice, along with Seville oranges, pineapple, pomegranate and star fruit are some of the most common foods that patients are told to avoid. Your healthcare team can tell you what you should not eat or drink with the specific medication you are taking. You can also find this information on the Food and Drug Administration insert that comes with your medication.

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I get enough nutrition?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">When you have cancer and are taking oral cancer agents, there are a number of side effects that can make it difficult for you to get the nutrition you need to keep your energy and strength up.

Mouth sores, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea can all keep you from eating or absorbing vitamins and fuel that your body needs.

Let your healthcare team know about any side effects that are keeping you from eating. If you're too tired to cook or the smell of food cooking makes you feel sick to your stomach, ask your healthcare provider about adding a nutritional supplement such as a meal replacement shake or bar.  You could also ask someone else to prepare meals ahead of time and freeze them to cut down on the amount of cooking you need to do.

There are links to sites with more information on nutrition for people with cancer in the Resources Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Can I continue to take my other medications?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Before you begin taking your oral cancer medication, make sure you tell your healthcare provider all the prescription and non-prescription medicines you are taking.
This is very important because some medicines can change the way cancer drugs work.
Make a list with the name of the drug, the dose, how often you take it, who prescribed it and why you are taking it. Take this list with you to your healthcare provider's visit.
Be sure to include any herbal and dietary supplements, vitamins and minerals and over-the-counter medications like aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, allergy medications, or cough and cold medicines.
Even eye drops, skin cream or patches can affect how well your cancer drugs work, and may also cause side effects or dangerous drug interactions.
Your healthcare provider will tell you if you should stop taking any of your regular medications before you start your cancer treatment.
Make sure you always check with your healthcare provider before taking any new medications or supplements.</Content>

This financial burden can weigh heavily on many people. It can also prevent some from following their treatment plan.

If you're having trouble paying for your medication there may be help. Many drug manufacturers have plans to help people pay for their drugs. Also, talk with your healthcare team. They may know about other resources to help pay for your oral cancer drugs.

Some states have passed laws that require insurance companies to cover oral cancer drugs the same way they cover IV cancer treatments.

Check out the Resources Area for more information on the financial issues and oral cancer drugs.</Content>

<Content id="0">It takes up to 48 hours for your body to break down or get rid of most cancer drugs. That means some of the drug may be present in your body fluids during that time.

If you need to go to the emergency room be sure to inform any healthcare worker you come into contact with, including EMTs or paramedics, that you are taking oral cancer drugs.

They may want to take safety precautions to prevent coming into contact with your bodily fluids.</Content>

<Content id="0">Many cancer patients who work fulltime continue working throughout treatment.
For many, working actually helps keeps their mind occupied and off their diagnosis.
If your work is physically or mentally demanding, doing your job may become more challenging, and you may need to adjust your schedule or your workload, or you may even need to take some time off during your treatment.  Feel free to discuss your desire to work with your healthcare team to determine a plan that will work best for you.
You are not obligated to tell your boss or co-workers about your diagnosis, but being open sometimes helps set realistic expectations, especially when asking for flexibility in your schedule and planning for absences.
Before you talk to anyone in your workplace about your diagnosis, find out if you have, and are eligible for, short-term or long-term disability insurance at your job. If you do decide to talk about your cancer, have a face-to-face meeting with your supervisor and express a strong desire to keep working. Let them know that while you currently plan to continue working, your situation might change.
If you disclose your diagnosis to your employer you may also be able to benefit from the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act. Keep in mind that what you tell your boss is protected information and should be kept in confidence.
You can find out more about the Americans with Disabilities and Family and Medical Leave acts in the Resources Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I get through work while taking cancer treatments?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Oral cancer drugs may make working through treatment a bit easier since you won't have to leave work to go to a treatment center, but side effects can still cause challenges.

Cancer meds can affect your memory and your ability to think clearly.  Some people find that using additional reminders can help them. You can use sticky notes, keep a calendar, record messages on your smart phone--whatever it takes to help you keep track of appointments, meetings and deadlines.

There are other things that may help you keep working through treatment, for instance:

&#8226; 	If possible, work from home some days. This might help you save energy and allow you to take care of yourself more easily if you have problems.
&#8226; 	If possible, get help at home with daily chores like housekeeping and cooking. This will help you conserve energy.
&#8226; 	If your co-workers know about your situation they may be able to help you come up with ways to better manage your work.
&#8226; 	Keep your supervisor up to date on how your schedule or other changes are working for you.
&#8226; 	Make a detailed list of job duties, so you can direct others in handling things when you're out of the office.
&#8226; 	Set limits. If you start to feel tired, take a break. Don't overdo it.</Content>

<Content id="0">Sometimes, even with good planning and extra time off, it may be too much to keep working during cancer treatment.

Talk with your healthcare team about how your treatment and symptoms are affecting your work. This may help you decide if or when you should think about taking time off.

Plan for possible disability early.  Don't put off taking leave until your work performance suffers.  If you are fired for doing a poor job, you can lose your health insurance as well as your income. And, if you're fired, you cannot collect disability benefits.

If your treatment starts causing too many problems for you at work, talk to your supervisor.

Explain that you want to keep working, but you need to take some time off.

Talk to someone from your human resources department to find out if you have short-term or long-term disability insurance at your job.

If you do, get applications for both -- just in case.

In general, short-term disability pays you some portion of your income for the first few months you are unable to work.

If you must be out longer, some employers also carry long-term disability insurance, which usually starts after 6 months of disability. You must meet the insurance company's definition of disability to get this income.

Even if your company does not offer disability insurance, you may still qualify for family medical leave under the FMLA program.  For more information on this program, look in the Resources Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I safely handle and store oral cancer drugs?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Taking oral cancer meds at home is more convenient, but these drugs are still very powerful and must be handled and stored carefully. It is important to protect others from coming into contact with your cancer medication.
Oral chemotherapy, hormones, and targeted therapies used in cancer treatment should be regarded as hazardous drugs. Oral cancer drugs usually come in the form of a capsule or tablet. They may contain traces of hazardous drugs on their surfaces. The outsides of bottles or blister packs may also contain traces of the drugs. Even though it may only be a trace amount, it can be absorbed through skin, inhaled, or ingested or can transfer to surfaces if not handled properly.
Pregnant caregivers should never handle oral cancer medication.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I administer oral cancer drugs at home?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Remember oral cancer drugs are powerful and potentially hazardous.

Make sure you and your caregiver take these special precautions to stay safe when handling oral cancer medications:
&#8226; Cancer drugs should remain in their original packaging until used or placed into daily pill boxes.
&#8226; Be careful not to inhale any dust that might enter the air when you open the pill bottle or package.
&#8226; Do not let the medication come in contact with household surfaces like countertops or tables, and if they do, clean the surface thoroughly afterwards to prevent others from coming in contact with traces of the drugs.
&#8226; Whenever possible, you should handle your drugs yourself.
&#8226; Wash your hands well before and after handling the pills.
&#8226; If anyone else is giving you your medication, they should put the pill into a medication cup or onto a spoon. Then you can tip the cup or spoon to your mouth to take the pills.
&#8226; Oral cancer drugs should not be crushed, split, broken or chewed.
&#8226; Caregivers should wear disposable gloves when handling oral cancer drugs.  Used gloves should never be re-used.  They should be thrown in the regular household trash after one use.
&#8226; Caregivers should wash their hands with soap and water after removing and throwing away the gloves.
&#8226; Pregnant caregivers should not handle oral cancer drugs.
&#8226; Also, pill containers for cancer drugs should never be reused.
&#8226; Remember to keep all drugs out of the reach of children and pets.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How do I store oral cancer drugs?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">&#8226; Keep oral cancer drugs in their original container until they are moved into the daily pillbox you use for your cancer medications only. Keeping your medications in their original containers will limit contamination and ensure that you always have the information about the name of the medication, the dose and other instructions. This is especially important if you are on multiple medications.
&#8226; Do not let your chemotherapy drugs come into contact with your other medications. They should always remain separate.
&#8226; Remember to wash your hands with soap and water after handling. Caregivers should always wear disposable gloves when handling cancer medications.
&#8226; Do not mix your oral cancer drugs with other meds in the pill box.
&#8226; Keep your meds in a cool, dry place away from heat, sunlight, or moisture. Bathrooms can be especially humid, so do not store your pills there.
&#8226; Store oral chemotherapy drugs away from food and drinks, and keep the pills out of reach of children and pets.</Content>

<Content id="0">Caregivers in the home should wear disposable gloves when handling any body fluids from people taking oral cancer pills.

It takes about 48 hours for the body to break down or get rid of most cancer drugs. During that time a small amount of the drug comes out in urine, stool, vomit and blood. Many oral chemotherapy agents are taken over months and sometimes even years without a break in treatment.  In these cases there will be a small amount of the drug in urine, stool, vomit, and blood at all time. This means that special precautions must be followed continuously.

Items soiled with body fluids should be kept in plastic bags until washed and should be washed separately from other laundry.

Pregnant caregivers should be very careful to not come into contact with oral cancer medications or bodily fluids.

Low-pressure toilets should be double-flushed after use by people taking oral cancer drugs, and always close the toilet lid before flushing. Be sure to wipe down any splashing that may have occurred with a disinfectant cleaner.

Take special care to keep pets or small children from playing in or drinking from the toilet. If possible, designate one bathroom in the home for your own personal use.</Content>

<Content id="0">Others in your home should wear gloves when handling trash or laundry soiled with your body fluids.

They should wash their hands with soap and water before putting on disposable gloves and after removing them.

Items that come into contact with cancer medication or bodily fluids can be thrown away in the household trash.

Before putting the waste in the trash, all the items should be doubled-bagged. Make sure they are in a leak-proof bag so others don't come in contact with it.

Check with your local waste management organization to know the best way to dispose of those agents.</Content>

<Content id="0">Small amounts of chemotherapy medication are released from the body through urine, stool, vomit and blood for up to 48 hours after you stop taking your cancer medication. Many oral chemotherapy agents are taken over months and sometimes even years without a break in treatment. In these cases there will be a small amount of drug in urine, stool, vomit and blood at all times. This means that special precautions must be followed continuously.

While taking oral cancer drugs, use these precautions to protect others from exposure to your body fluids:

&#8226; 	After using the toilet, close the lid and flush twice.
&#8226; 	Men should try to avoid splashing when urinating. Sitting down when urinating is a good way to avoid accidental splashing.
&#8226; 	After using the toilet, wash hands well with soap and water. If any fluids splashed on your skin, clean the area with soap and water.
&#8226; 	If any fluids splash on any surface make sure to clean it well with a disinfectant cleaner.

Caregivers or others living with you also need to take precautions to avoid coming into contact with your body fluids.

Caregivers should:

&#8226; 	Wear gloves when cleaning the toilet or cleaning up any urine, stool, vomit or blood, or when changing diapers or incontinence pads. They should dispose of gloves in the trash, then wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water.

&#8226; 	If emptying a bedpan or urinal, they should wear gloves and dump contents into the toilet close to the water to limit splashing. While wearing the gloves, they should wash the container with soap and water after each use.

&#8226; 	Diapers should be double-bagged and can then be disposed of in the regular trash.

If you have an ostomy, it is best to use disposable pouches if possible, rather than rinsing and reusing them. If disposable pouches are not possible, the collection bag should be washed once a day with soap and water.</Content>

<Content id="0">It is safe to touch, and hug your loved ones while you are taking cancer drugs. Traces of oral cancer drugs may be present in saliva, semen and vaginal fluid, so healthy partners should take care to avoid contact with these bodily fluids.
While it is usually safe to have sex while taking oral cancer meds, you should discuss this with your healthcare team. Condoms may be required since the cancer drugs can be found in semen and vaginal fluid.
Also, both men and women of childbearing age should avoid conception while either they or their partner are taking oral cancer drugs. These are very powerful drugs and can damage a fetus and cause birth defects.
As some cancer treatments can affect fertility, people who wish to have children may want to explore fertility preservation options.  For more information look in the Resources Area.</Content>

<Content id="0">Infection is one of the biggest dangers for someone with a weakened immune system.  Hand washing is the best way to prevent infection.
Others things you can do to reduce your risk of infection:

&#8226;	 Wash your hands frequently, especially before you eat and after using the bathroom.  And, make sure that others around you also wash their hands frequently.
&#8226;	 Keep your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth.
&#8226;	 Stay away from crowds.
&#8226;	 Avoid contact with anyone who is sick.
&#8226;	 Be careful not to cut or nick yourself.
&#8226;	 Use an electric razor rather than a straight razor to shave.
&#8226;	 Avoid emptying or handling pet waste.
&#8226; 	If you feel comfortable doing so, and your healthcare provider suggests it, you may want to wear a disposable face mask when you're out in public.
&#8226;	 And, do not have dental work done while your blood count is low.

<Content id="0">Wash clothing and linen as usual unless it is soiled with body fluids.  While taking cancer drugs a small amount of the drug comes out of your body in urine, stool and vomit.

If you can't wash soiled items immediately put them in plastic bags until they can be washed. Then wash them separately from other laundry.

If anyone else is handling your soiled clothing or linens they should always wear disposable gloves.

Pregnant caregivers should be very careful not to come in contact with oral cancer drugs or the bodily fluids of someone taking these medications.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are some potential drug interactions?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Oral cancer medications may interact with other prescription or over-the-counter drugs, as well as herbal medicines and even some foods.

The chances of a drug interaction increases with the number of medications you take.

You should keep a list of all the prescription and non-prescription medicines you are taking, including over-the-counter medications, skin patches, creams, eye drops, nasal sprays, vitamins and herbal supplements. This list should be shared with your healthcare team and any other health care provider you see. Because some medicines can affect how well cancer drugs work and may also cause adverse side effects or drug interactions, it is very important that you keep this list up-to-date and give the updated list to your healthcare providers as well.

Your list should include:
&#8226; 	The name of the drug
&#8226; 	The dose
&#8226; 	How often you take it
&#8226; 	Who prescribed it
&#8226; 	And why you are taking it

Double check with your healthcare team if you have any questions about your medications you are taking. You can also check the insert included with your cancer medication. It will list any possible adverse reactions with other drugs or food.

Even trace amounts of these drugs can be hazardous to others and it is important to lower their risk of exposure.  Because treatment with oral cancer drugs outside of medical facilities is a fairly new concept, guidelines about disposal can vary.  We've provided some general guidelines to prevent accidental contact, but it may be a good idea to call your local waste management company to find out what they recommend as well.</Content>

<Content id="0">Usually you will not have any extra medication left over. However, if you have leftover drugs it is important to dispose of them as safely as possible.

Never throw cancer drugs in the trash or down the drain and don't flush them down the toilet.

Instead you can:
&#8226; Ask your healthcare team if unused medication can be returned to the doctor's office, pharmacy or treatment center for safe disposal.
&#8226; Check with your local health department to find out where you can safely dispose of any unused cancer drugs.
&#8226; Find an authorized collection location near you by using a locating tool on the Drug Enforcement Agency's website which you can find in the Resources Area.
&#8226; Or, check with the company that collects your trash for their policy on cancer medication disposal.
&#8226; If you have additional questions about disposing of unused or expired medications, ask your healthcare team or pharmacist.

You can also call the Food and Drug Administration or FDA Their contact information is in the Resources Area.

Empty pill bottles may be put in the household trash. Do not recycle them. Before throwing them out, remove the label or completely cross out any personal information. And never reuse cancer medication pill bottles. Check with your local waste management organization for how to best dispose of them.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How do I manage side effects?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Taking oral cancer drugs at home is much more convenient, and some people think they will have fewer and less severe side effects.

Unfortunately, that is not always the case.  Most people will have at least some side effects.

The severity of side effects varies from drug to drug and person to person.

Side effects from cancer meds affect how you feel physically and mentally. They are one of the main reasons people fail to follow their treatment plan.

If you experience side effects after taking your cancer drugs, do not stop taking your medication. Talk to your healthcare team as soon as you begin experiencing any side effects because many can be successfully managed.

If not treated early some side effects can become serious, even life threatening. It's very important to know the side effects that are specific to your oral cancer drugs and when to report them. There are symptoms that need immediate attention and need to be reported to your healthcare provider right away. Call your healthcare team immediately if you have any of the following:

&#8226; 	A temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit
&#8226; 	Chest pain
&#8226; 	Trouble breathing
&#8226; 	Stomach swelling, tenderness, or pain
&#8226; 	Dark urine
&#8226; 	Bloody or dark stool
&#8226; 	Nausea or vomiting despite taking anti-nausea medications

<BaseQuestion id="0">Will my hair fall out?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">One of the most distressing side effects from cancer drugs is hair loss, also called alopecia. The scalp is not the only area affected. Hair found anywhere on the body, including eyebrows, eyelashes, facial hair, underarm hair and pubic hair can be affected.

Not all patients lose their hair during cancer treatment. You may lose all your hair or just some; it all depends on the kind of drug and dosage you are taking. And some oral cancer drugs can also cause changes in the texture, color, and growth pattern of your hair.

Hair loss doesn't happen overnight. It is usually a gradual process happening over one to three weeks after the first treatment cycle. For others it may happen over several treatment cycles.

Hair loss can be a source of anxiety or social isolation as it is a visual reminder of your diagnosis and treatment. It can be helpful to develop a plan with your health care provider for what you can do in terms of wigs, scarves or hats before actually losing your hair. If your hair does fall out, be sure to protect your scalp from the sun and cold.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Will my hair grow back?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Your hair will not instantly grow back once treatment is done. It may take three to six months after you finish therapy for your hair to grow back.

Typically hair loss is temporary; but, when it does come back, new hair may have a slightly different color, texture or curl.

If you do lose your hair, you should gently wash your scalp and watch for any signs of infection. If you develop crusty lesions on the skin or scalp, report them to your healthcare team. You may need to be checked for infection.

Hair loss can be a source of anxiety or social isolation as it is a visual reminder of your diagnosis and treatment. It can be helpful to develop a plan with your health care provider for what you can do in terms of wigs, scarves or hats before actually losing your hair.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Should I get a wig?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Choosing to wear a wig is a personal preference. If you decide you want to wear a wig, check with your insurance company. Many plans will cover part or all of the cost of a wig if your healthcare provider writes a prescription. Ask for a prescription for an "extra-cranial prosthesis" -- that is a wig!

If you don't have coverage, call your local chapter of the American Cancer Society or your cancer center. They may offer free wigs.

For more information on picking a wig or other options for head coverings, check the Resources Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the treatment for diarrhea?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Medication and dietary changes may help you minimize or avoid the effects of diarrhea caused by cancer drugs.

The most effective treatment for diarrhea with oral cancer drugs is medication.  Your healthcare provider may recommend that you take loperamide, commonly known as Imodium, which is available over the counter, or they may prescribe another medication, such as Octreotide.  Make sure you talk to your healthcare provider before you take any over-the-counter or prescription medications.

You can also make some dietary changes that may help.

&#8226; 	Eat small, frequent meals with foods containing soluble fiber like bananas, rice, well-cooked eggs, mashed potatoes, applesauce, and canned fruits and vegetables.

&#8226; 	Avoid foods that are high in fiber or fat, fried foods, dairy, alcohol, caffeine and insoluble fiber including raw fruit and vegetables, nuts, popcorn, skins, and seeds.

If you have diarrhea, you need to make sure you drink enough fluid so you do not become dehydrated.  Drink 8-10 glasses of clear fluids a day. Clear fluids include water, non-caffeinated sports drinks, broth, weak and decaffeinated teas, clear juices and gelatin.

For more on actions you can take to minimize this side effect check out our Resources Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is nausea and vomiting?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Nausea is the feeling of needing or wanting to vomit, and vomiting is the act of throwing up.

Nausea and vomiting is described in three ways.

Acute-onset nausea occurs within a few minutes to several hours after taking cancer meds and goes away within the first 24 hours.

Delayed-onset nausea and vomiting occurs more than 24 hours after taking cancer meds.

And anticipatory nausea and vomiting is a side effect that can occur before you receive your next chemotherapy treatment.

Nausea can become serious if it prevents you from taking or keeping down your medication, food and liquids.  Uncontrolled vomiting can lead to:

&#8226; 	Dehydration
&#8226; 	Poor nutrition
&#8226; 	Fatigue

Nausea and vomiting can affect how well your treatment works and can make it necessary for the healthcare providers to reduce your doses or even delay your treatment.   It can even be life threatening if it is not managed.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What can be done to help ease nausea and vomiting side effect?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The most effective way to prevent vomiting is to take anti-nausea medications prescribed by your healthcare provider.  In most cases, if the oral cancer drugs you are taking are known to cause nausea and vomiting, your healthcare provider will prescribe medications for you to prevent these symptoms.  If you are not given medication, and then you have nausea and vomiting or have vomiting even if taking these medications, call your healthcare team right away. Do not wait. It can be difficult to eliminate the sensation of nausea, however current medications used for this are extremely effective to prevent vomiting.

There are also some dietary changes you can try that may also help.

&#8226; 	Eat small, frequent meals.
&#8226; 	Avoid spicy, fatty, or highly salted foods.
&#8226; 	Drink fluids throughout the day like water and juices. If you are vomiting it is important to replace lost fluids in order to avoid becoming dehydrated.

Some patients also find that progressive muscle relaxation helps with nausea and vomiting.</Content>

<Content id="0">Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms experienced by people with cancer.

Most patients describe this as much more than just feeling tired. It is a feeling of complete physical and mental exhaustion where even the smallest effort seems impossible.

Usually, it is not the result of activity or exertion, and it is not relieved by rest or sleep.

Fatigue can be caused by many things, so it is important to tell your healthcare team if you notice a change in your energy level.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the treatment for fatigue?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Moving around may seem like the last thing you want to do when you are tired, but physical activity has been found to be one of the most helpful ways to reduce fatigue.

The right level of activity depends on your lifestyle and health, so always talk to your healthcare team about what activities you can do safely.

Ask your healthcare team for an "activity prescription" -- this will give you a recommended type, duration and frequency of physical activity.  In general, recommendations for people during treatment for cancer is the same as that for the general population: about 30 minutes a day, at least 3 days per week, as long as you do not have other conditions that limit your ability to exercise.

There are some things to remember when you start becoming more physical active:

&#8226; 	Start slowly. This may mean just walking around the dining room table once. Try to go a little further each time. This allows your body time to adjust.
&#8226; 	Try to do some kind of physical activity every day or at least every other day.
&#8226; 	The right kind of activity should never make you feel sore, stiff, or exhausted.

If you experience any of these feelings you may be overdoing it and it may be time to call your healthcare team.

Also, tell your healthcare team if you experience any of the following:

&#8226; 	Fatigue that limits your ability to care for yourself
&#8226; 	Increased shortness of breath with little activity
&#8226; 	Dizziness
&#8226; 	Uncontrolled pain
&#8226; 	Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or loss of appetite
&#8226; 	Uncontrollable anxiety or nervousness
&#8226; 	Ongoing depression

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the treatment for constipation?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are some things you can do to prevent or relieve constipation.

You can:
&#8226; Eat foods high in fiber like fruits, cereals, and vegetables. Prune, pear and apple juices may help. You may also consider meeting with a nutritionist to discuss your diet.
&#8226; Drink two to three liters of non-alcoholic fluids each day, unless your healthcare provider tells you otherwise.
&#8226; Stay physically active.

Pain medication often cause constipation. If you are taking pain medication, you may want to take a stool softener or laxative to prevent constipation. Remember to always talk to your healthcare provider before taking any over-the-counter or prescription medicines. There are also medications your healthcare provider can recommend for constipation, if these methods don't help.

<Content id="0">A cancer diagnosis may cause anyone to feel sad or down, but when that sadness persists and affects your usual activities you may be depressed.  Depression can be a side effect of many cancer drugs. It could be a sign that your cancer medication or treatment needs to be adjusted.

Do not wait to contact your healthcare team if you think you may be depressed.  If un-treated, depression only gets worse. The sooner you let your healthcare team know how you are feeling, the sooner you can find relief. Your healthcare provider may prescribe anti-depressants. Remember it can take up to two weeks for antidepressant medication to begin working. You may also be referred to a counselor to help you find ways to cope with your situation. Getting professional help for depression is just as important as taking your medications. Relaxation therapy can also be helpful.

There are a variety of other treatments you can try to help ease the pain from nerve damage. Working with physical therapy to improve balance has been shown to be helpful. Acupuncture, physical therapy and gentle massage have shown mixed results when treating the symptoms of nerve damage. But some people find them helpful.

<Content id="0">Cancer treatments can cause sexual changes for some patients. This is not unusual, and you are not alone.

The most common issue is overall loss of desire. Just dealing with side effects from your cancer treatment may take so much energy that sex is not high on your priority list.

For women, vaginal dryness and pain are often reported. For men, erectile problems are common. Most men and women are still able to have an orgasm, but it is common to need more time or stimulation to reach orgasm. If you are not receiving treatment for a hormone sensitive tumor, you may be a candidate for hormone replacement treatment.

One of the most important things you can do is to share your concerns with your partner and talk to your healthcare team.</Content>

<Content id="0">Some people experience memory problems or a mental cloudiness, which is sometimes called "chemo brain".

Patients often describe trouble concentrating, forgetfulness, trouble multi-tasking, taking longer to finish things and trouble remembering common words. These problems have been a known side effect of radiation treatment, but only recently have been linked to chemotherapy and other cancer treatments. For most people these changes last only a short time, but for others it can go on for years and can affect your everyday life. So tell your healthcare team about any changes in your thinking or behavior that begins to affect your lifestyle.

There are also some physical conditions than can cause confusion. They include:
&#8226; Dehydration
&#8226; Anemia
&#8226; Heart problems
&#8226; A severe infection in your blood or central nervous system
&#8226; Thyroid disorders
&#8226; Depression
&#8226; Lack of Sleep
&#8226; And alcohol use or abuse.

Make sure you and your healthcare team rule out any of these conditions.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a rash?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The most common type of skin reaction is a rash. It is often bright red in color and the skin may feel hot, burning, or itchy.  The rash may begin with a small, raised pimple or small pus-filled blister or may be a flat reddened area on the skin. It typically appears on the face, scalp, and upper chest and back and can look like acne. The rash may extend over your entire body except for the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Most rashes start early in treatment, usually during the first two weeks, and can develop into a secondary infection of lesions.

You may also have other symptoms including:
&#8226; Peeling of the skin
&#8226; Wet or dry open so
&#8226; Fever
&#8226; Swollen lymph nodes
&#8226; And loss of appetite.

There are many other kinds of skin reactions caused by cancer medications.

<BaseQuestion id="0">How do I treat a rash?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are medications that may help relieve the symptoms of a rash, so make sure your healthcare provider is aware of any skin issues. In addition to the medications, you can play an important role in managing this symptom by caring for your skin throughout treatment.

Things you can do are:
&#8226; Moisturize your skin with products that are hypoallergenic and free of perfume or alcohol.
&#8226; Use gentle soaps and shampoos when washing. Avoid lotions or gels containing alcohol.
&#8226; Pat skin dry with a soft, clean towel to reduce the risk of infection.
&#8226; Shave with caution.
&#8226; Wear smooth, non-binding clothing made of natural fibers.
&#8226; Avoid sun exposure. When outdoors wear a hat and protective clothing, and use sunscreen that provides protection against both UVA and UVB rays.
&#8226; Use makeup that does not clog skin pores.
&#8226; Monitor for signs of infection and report symptoms to the healthcare team.

Your healthcare provider may prescribe medications to prevent and treat the rash and relieve any itching.  Do not treat a chemo-related rash with anti-acne medications. Chemo-related rash is very different from acne and the treatment is as well.

It is not unusual for your healthcare provider to change the dosage of your oral cancer drug as needed to balance your treatment effectiveness while reducing skin side effects.  Do not change your dosage unless instructed by your healthcare provider.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are some other skin problems that can come from oral cancer drugs?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">People taking targeted therapy drugs may have other skin reactions. These kinds of drugs can cause severe dry skin, a severe acne-like rash, or fissures, which are cuts or cracks in the skin.

Some measures you can take to prevent these skin problems are:
&#8226; Take baths or showers with lukewarm water.
&#8226; Use small amounts of soap or use oils rather than soap.
&#8226; And apply a thick moisturizer at least daily.
&#8226; Avoid skin contact with solvents or disinfectants, and wear gloves when doing things like housecleaning or dishes.

Fissures are best treated with a medical-grade liquid skin adhesive for immediate closure. Your healthcare provider should be able to tell you what product to use.</Content>

<Content id="0">The darkening of the skin is called hyperpigmentation and it is a common skin reaction, particularly in dark-skinned people.

This can occur as an overall darkening of the skin, or it can be localized, showing up in areas exposed to light as a golden brown or slate grey color change.

Some drugs may also cause darkening of the skin over the finger joints and under the nails, as well as the tongue and gums.

Most hyperpigmentation occurs within two to three weeks after starting treatment and goes away 10 to 12 weeks after stopping treatment. Occasionally the hyperpigmentation may be permanent.</Content>

<Content id="0">Symptoms of hand-foot syndrome include numbness, tingling, swelling of the hands and feet called edema, red patches, blistering and thick calluses on the palms and soles.

Symptoms may not occur until the second week after starting therapy.

Remember to look at both the feet as well as the hands. One may be affected more severely than the other. It's a good idea to examine the bottom of your feet every day when removing your shoes and socks.</Content>

<Content id="0">Call your healthcare team as soon as symptoms of hand foot syndrome appear as it is important to treat this side effect.

There are some things you can do to manage hand foot syndrome:
&#8226;	 Avoid hot water, bathe in lukewarm water to reduce symptoms.
&#8226;	 Avoid high-impact exercise or activities.
&#8226;	 Avoid actions that will put pressure on the palms, like using garden tools or kitchen knives.
&#8226;	 Keep your toenails short and wear shoes that do not push on nails -- tight shoes don't necessarily cause this problem, but can make hand-foot syndrome worse and cause discomfort.

If symptoms do not improve, call your healthcare team. They may recommend cleaning with antiseptic solutions, such as a weak vinegar or very weak bleach solution. Topical and other medications may be needed.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Will I experience sleep problems?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Sleep problems are reported by up to 90 percent of patients with cancer.

Often times, cancer drugs cause people to feel tired and sleepy throughout the day.  They end up napping or sleeping during the day and that leads to difficulty sleeping at night.

Sometimes sleep problems are caused by medications prescribed to combat the side effects of chemotherapy.

Stress and tension about your diagnosis and treatment can also cause sleep problems. Other side effect such as hot flashes, peripheral neuropathy and fatigue can contribute to sleep disturbance.

Depending on the reasons you are having trouble sleeping, your health care provider may prescribe medication to help you sleep better.

And, there are some things you can do to help improve your sleep:
&#8226;	 When you rise each day try to get at least 20 min of exposure to bright, natural light.
&#8226;	 Make sure you are taking your medications at the right time of day.
&#8226;	 Try not to take naps during the day.
&#8226;	 Cut down on caffeine and especially avoid drinking caffeine in the evening.
&#8226;	 Also, do not eat or exercise within 2 hours of bedtime.
&#8226;	 Keep a consistent sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.
&#8226;	 Start a routine before bedtime, using a relaxation technique you prefer that does not include using a computer screen or watching TV.
&#8226;	 Use your bed only for sleeping, not for watching TV or reading.
&#8226;	 Make your room dark, cool and quiet.
&#8226;	 If you are unable to get to sleep, don't stay in the bed.  Do something to help you relax.

If you are still having problems sleeping, try keeping a sleep diary to show to your healthcare provider.

For more on keeping a sleep diary check out the Resources Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Will there be changes to the way things taste?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">About 50% of people experience taste changes during treatment.  The exact reason for taste changes is not clear, but it is might be a result of the damage to the cells in the oral cavity, which are especially sensitive to cancer drugs.
Many people say they can no longer tolerate spicy foods and describe most food as tasting bland, bitter, or like chemicals. These changes may occur during your drug therapy and last for hours, days, weeks, or even months after treatment stops.
There are no medications to help with taste changes, but some studies have suggested deficiencies in vitamins and minerals can lead to taste changes.  Talk to your healthcare provider before adding any vitamins or supplements to your diet, as some may cause dangerous interactions or cause your cancer medications to be less effective.
Check out the Resources Area for ways to manage these taste changes. Also, make sure to call your healthcare provider if your taste changes have caused you to stop eating and you have lost any weight.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Will I lose my appetite?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Many people taking cancer medications report a loss of appetite or no desire to eat. This can be caused by pain, depression, nausea and vomiting or advanced disease.

Some things that may help with your lack of appetite are:
&#8226; Eat small meals or snacks, every two to three hours, instead of three large meals a day
&#8226; Eat foods that are rich in nutrients and high in protein or calories.
&#8226; Avoid low-calorie foods
&#8226; Drink nutrient-dense fluids such as milk, milk shakes, juice and punch
-type drink
&#8226; Avoid heavy meals, greasy or fried foods, and foods that cause gas.
&#8226; Prepare food that is colorful and appealing to the eye.

Talk to your healthcare provider about your appetite issues. There are medications that may be prescribed to combat lack of appetite. Your healthcare provider may also be able to give you a referral to a registered dietician to help you plan and implement oral nutritional interventions. Dietary supplements can also be helpful but make sure you check with your healthcare provider before taking any supplements.

<Content id="0">Bone marrow is the spongy tissue in the center of the bones. It is where red and white blood cells and platelets are made. Some cancer drugs can destroy bone marrow, causing your body to produce fewer blood cells. A drop in the levels of any of these cells can lead to side effects.

Bone marrow suppression also called immune suppression, or blood cell suppression, is one of the most common reasons cancer treatment is delayed or modified. It can cause several significant dangers for cancer patients. One of the biggest dangers is infection.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a low white blood cell count?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">White blood cells fight infection. A low white blood cell count significantly increases your risk of infection. If you have a low white blood cell count you may hear or see terms like neutropenia, leukopenia or granulocytopenia. These are the names of different types of white blood cells in your body that may be affected by your oral cancer drugs.
There is nothing you can do to raise your white blood cell count on your own, but there are things you can do to reduce your risk of infection. They include:
&#8226; Wash your hands often during the day, especially before you eat and use the bathroom.
&#8226; Stay away from crowds.
&#8226; Avoid contact with anyone who is sick.
&#8226; Do not have dental work done while your white blood cell count is low.
&#8226; Be careful not to cut or nick yourself.
&#8226; Wear gloves when working in the garden.
&#8226; Avoid emptying or handling pet waste.
&#8226; Wash all fresh fruits and vegetables thoroughly.
&#8226; Avoid eating uncooked or undercooked meat.
&#8226; Also, if your healthcare provider recommends it and you feel comfortable, you may choose to wear a face mask when out in public.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the treatment for low red blood count?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Depending your situation your healthcare provider may prescribe medication, an iron supplement, multivitamin, a high protein diet, or even a blood transfusion. There are some things you can do to help manage a low red blood cell count.

&#8226; Rest between activities.
&#8226; Plan ahead and save energy for the most important activities.
&#8226; Avoid or stop activities that make you short of breath or make your heart beat faster.

However, once you determine that your blood counts are at a safe level, it is important to gradually become more active.
Learn more about increasing activity in the Resources Area.

&#8226; You should also maintain a well-balanced diet including iron-rich foods.
&#8226; If supplements such as iron, B12, or folate are prescribed make sure you take them.
&#8226; Drink plenty of non-caffeinated and non-alcoholic fluids.
&#8226; Use an electric razor to shave rather than a straight razor.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a low platelet count?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Another danger caused by bone marrow suppression is a low platelet count. Platelets are colorless blood cells that help blood clot. They line the inside of the blood vessel. When you have a low platelet count this layer thins and tiny drops of blood can leak through the spaces made when the layers thin. This causes red dots on the skin called petechiae (pa-TEE-kee-eye). A low blood platelet count puts you at an increased risk of bruising and bleeding.</Content>

<Content id="0">If you suddenly experience nausea, dizziness, loss of vision, severe headaches, or confusion, seek medical help immediately. If you have hypertension, know the signs of stroke and get immediate medical help if any of these occur.

If you are on medication for high blood pressure, take your medication as ordered. Unless you check your own blood pressure regularly, you will not know if your pressure is high, and you should not stop taking your medication because you "feel OK."

There are things you can do to reduce your risk of developing high blood pressure:
&#8226;	 Quit smoking
&#8226;	 Exercise at least 20 to 30 minutes a day
&#8226;	 Try to reduce the amount of stress in your life
&#8226;	 Avoid alcohol use and limit caffeine intake
&#8226;	 Eat a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol, low in sodium

<BaseQuestion id="0">Do oral cancer drug cause pain?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Some people getting cancer treatment will have pain.  The pain may come from the cancer itself or it can be a side effect of some oral cancer drugs. Pain can affect how clearly you can think and your ability to accomplish daily activities. Because it often gets worse at night, it can also interfere with sleep which can also affect how well you can concentrate the next day.
Assess pain often and talk to your healthcare team about your pain, especially if it interferes with your sleep.  To help your healthcare provider diagnose and manage your pain you can keep a pain diary. For more information on using a pain diary check out the Resources Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I lessen or manage the pain with medication?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">If you have pain from your cancer and are on pain medications that need to be taken at specific times, it is important to stick to your pain medication schedule.  If you skip a pain pill until your pain is worse, you may experience more pain and your pain medication may not work as well. The idea is to maintain a constant level of medications in your body.  Side effects from increasing pain medication can also make it difficult for you to manage your cancer treatment plan.  Keeping pain in check by sticking to a medication schedule is the best way to manage pain and prevent the need for more medication.</Content>

<Content id="0">There are some other things you can do to help control pain from cancer or nerve damage.  Warm showers or baths, hot water bottles or warm washcloths help relax muscles.  Sometimes, the opposite helps -- cool washcloths can help sooth swellings and headaches.  Massage, deep breathing, meditation and other approaches may also be helpful.  For more information on these and other pain management strategies, look in the Resources Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is venous thromboembolism?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Blood clots that form in a vein are called venous thromboembolism or VTE.  VTE is a frequent and serious complication in patients with cancer. The lower extremities are the most common sites for a blood clot to form. If the blood clot dislodges and gets into the blood stream it can travel to the heart or lungs causing a life threatening condition and even death.
Many factors can influence the risk for developing VTE, including the type and site of cancer. The highest rate of VTE happens within the first year of a cancer diagnosis.</Content>

<Content id="0">To prevent blood clots keep moving.
Try to walk at least 30 minutes, three times a week.
Wearing compression stockings, especially if you're not able to be mobile, can also help prevent blood clots.  This can be especially helpful if you'll be sitting for several hours at a time and cannot get up and walk, for instance if you're flying or riding somewhere.
Avoid dehydration. Make sure you drink eight glass of fluid a day. Water is best, but sugar free and non-caffeinated drinks are an alternative.
If your healthcare team thinks that you're at high risk for developing blood clots or you have already had a blood clot you may be prescribed blood thinners.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What kind of eye problems can be caused by cancer drugs?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Depending on what type of oral cancer drug you are taking, you could experience some problems with your eyes or your vision.

One side effect is a condition where the eyelashes become elongated and may irritate the eye.

You should not cut the eyelashes. If the irritation continues, an ophthalmologist may need to evaluate for possible removal of the lashes.

Another eye problem caused by cancer treatment is often called dry eyes. This can cause a decrease in vision, eye pain, or the feeling of having something in your eye. For mild symptoms, artificial tears may be all that is needed. In severe cases, an ophthalmologist should be consulted for treatment.

People who are taking tamoxifen may be at greater risk for developing cataracts. Cataracts are a clouding of the normally clear lens of your eye. Cataracts can cause blurry vision, or make it seem as though you're looking through a frosty window. These vision changes are permanent unless the cataracts are removed during surgery.

You should have your vision checked before you begin treatment with tamoxifen and have it checked regularly throughout your treatment.

Let your healthcare team know if you are having any of these changes to your vision:
&#8226; Cloudy or blurry vision.
&#8226; Trouble seeing in the dark, or at night.
&#8226; Colors appearing to be faded, or dull.
&#8226; Or double vision

You may have to change your eyeglass prescription frequently during treatment as changes to your vision occur.

You should call the healthcare provider immediately if:
&#8226; You have any sudden severe eye pain
&#8226; You have a sudden loss of vision, or if you see halos
&#8226; If your eyes become sensitive to light.
&#8226; Or if your eye problems worsen or do not improve within 3 days of treatment.

Reporting symptoms to your healthcare provider early is essential, and they may need to send you to a specialist for treatment. For more information on other eye problems caused by oral cancer therapy check out the Resources Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How do I keep a record of my symptoms and side effects?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Side effects can be very specific to the type of oral cancer drug you are taking. Track the side effects that you are told to expect on a daily basis and know when to call your healthcare provider. Note the date and time the side effect occurs, how long it lasts, how intense it is, and give examples of how your daily activities are affected.

Patients report a variety of different ways of keeping track of symptoms and side effects that work for them. Some use a treatment diary as a way of recording side effects they experience, others use electronic tablets. Your health care provider team may have resources for you as well.
Whatever you choose, you will want to be sure you are able to use it consistently.

In addition to the side effects experienced, you will also want to note:
&#8226; Factors that helped or made symptoms worse
&#8226; Medications you took, and other methods you tried to help with symptoms and if it worked or not.

A general symptom reporting checklist is located in the Resources Area.</Content>

<Content id="0">Your healthcare provider's office or clinic will be able to tell you the best way to stay in touch with them, but you should also ask about electronic healthcare portals, email, phone numbers for regular office hours and after hours contact.

It is important to find out how to best contact the office for non-emergency reasons such as a prescription refill or to ask the nurse a non-urgent question,

Be sure that you know who to contact during regular business hours, as well as nights, weekends and holidays as often there will be a different number to use during off hours.</Content>

<Content id="0">At this time, you're probably more in tune with your body than you've ever been in your life. You notice every physical change and imbalance. Do not take any physical symptoms you may have lightly.

Some side effects are fleeting and minor, but others may be a sign of serious, even life-threatening problems.
Your healthcare provide will tell you what symptoms are most common for the oral cancer drugs you are taking and which symptoms signal a life-threatening emergency.

No matter what medication you are on, tell your healthcare provider right away if you suffer from any of the following symptoms during your treatment:
&#8226; A fever of 100.4 or greater
&#8226; Bleeding or unexplained bruising
&#8226; A rash or allergic reaction, such as swelling of the mouth or throat, severe itching, trouble breathing or swallowing
&#8226; Intense chills
&#8226; Unusual pain, including intense headaches
&#8226; Shortness of breath or trouble breathing
&#8226; Long-lasting diarrhea or vomiting
&#8226; Bloody stool or blood in your urine

It is very important that you do not stop taking or skip doses of your oral cancer drugs unless instructed to do so by your healthcare provider.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is mucositis?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Mucositis is the inflammation of any part of the digestive tract. It can cause painful sores and ulcers in the mouth, throat and lips and can interfere with your ability to eat, swallow, talk, and chew. It also puts you at risk for infection.

Mucositis is one of the most common side effects from cancer treatment and one of the most common reasons for treatment delay and dose reduction.

There is prescription medication that can treat mouth sores, so make sure your healthcare team is aware of the problem.

&#8226; To avoid mucositis, assess your mouth on a daily basis, looking for pain, redness, and ulcer formation.
&#8226; Maintain good oral hygiene -- brush your teeth at least twice a day with a soft toothbrush for 90 seconds or more and floss regularly.

During treatment, you should use mouth rinses after meals and before bed to keep your mouth clean. Rinse the mouth four times daily using a saltwater or a baking soda and water mixture. Do not use mouthwashes that contain alcohol. They can cause the membranes in your mouth to dry out.

If you have mouth sores increase mouth rinse regimen to every two hours while awake. Denture wearers should remove their dentures when cleaning their mouth.

Some other things you can do to prevent mucositis are:
&#8226; Avoid spicy or acidic foods, tobacco, and alcohol.
&#8226; Suck on hard candy to increase saliva and keep your mouth moist.
&#8226; Avoid sharp, crunchy foods to reduce the possibility of irritation and injury to your mouth.
&#8226; Keep hydrated.
&#8226; And avoid licking your lips as this leads to further dryness, and use a water-based moisturizer to keep lips moist.

Call your healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms:
&#8226; Temperature above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit
&#8226; Sores and pain that interfere with eating, drinking or sleeping
&#8226; Or a heavily coated tongue

<Content id="0">Some oral cancer drugs affect heart function.  People taking some oral cancer medications can be at higher risk for abnormal heart rate or rhythms called dysrhythmias, heart failure, hypertension, or high blood pressure, and blood clots in the vein, called venous thromboembolism or VTE.  You can learn more about each of these conditions using the links in the related questions section, or you can type in a question of your own.

Remember to call your healthcare provider immediately if you have any of the following symptoms:
&#8226; Fever of 100.4 degrees
&#8226; Chills
&#8226; Sore throat
&#8226; Excessive shortness of breath, chest pain, jaw pain or discomfort
&#8226; Feeling your heart beat rapidly (palpitations)

<BaseQuestion id="0">Simply because they're pills does not mean you won't experience side effects to the same degree as you would with some of the other agents.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Sometimes there can be a misconception that oral chemotherapy drugs may not be as serious or cause the amount of side effects as that some of the more commonly known intravenous chemotherapy drugs can cause but that is simply not the case. And we are seeing more and more oral chemotherapeutic agents being used in the management of cancer today, so it is very important to know that you can see just the same level of seriousness of the side effects of oral agents as you can see with the IV agents. The same level of nausea and vomiting and simply because they're pills does not mean you won't experience side effects to the same degree as you would with some of the other agents.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">The biggest message I would give is to not think that you have to just deal with that along with all the other things that you're going through.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">So psychosocial issues such as depression and anxiety very frequently go alongside with a traumatic experience like a cancer diagnosis and something as overwhelming as starting treatment for cancer. †We can very commonly see patients experience depression or a new onset anxiety that goes along with this. And I would say the biggest message is that it's not something that you just have to deal with because you're going through this diagnosis in this major life-changing event. It's something that healthcare providers are very used to managing hand-in-hand and we can often expect some level of depression and anxiety that goes along with a cancer diagnosis and starting treatment as well as a variety of other psycho social complications. So the biggest message I would give is to not think that you have to just deal with that along with all the other things that you're going through, with the cancer diagnosis and starting new treatment and to talk about that with your healthcare provider as well. There's pharmacologic agents we can use and there's many non-pharmacologic coping strategies that a lot of times cancer patients feel comforted by while undergoing therapy.</Content>

<Content id="0">It's absolutely crucial to be in contact with your healthcare providers every step of the way. I always tell patients that everybody will experience side effects in their own unique individual way and although we may be able to anticipate some side effects everybody can experience them differently. So very important to be in contact with your healthcare provider if you notice any differences, any changes, something that may not seem like a big deal to you or your family caring for you could be a major side effect or a reason to possibly hold the drug. And you know we're learning more and more about some of these newer drugs and it's very important to be in contact with your healthcare care provider, let them know what you're experiencing, how you're tolerating the drug, so that we can intervene quickly, get you some supportive care to manage the side effects, and alter doses if we need to.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Sometimes it can be uncomfortable to talk about the degree to which are experiencing diarrhea, but cannot stress enough that they really do need to know.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">So again, stressing the importance of letting your provider know if you're experiencing it. Sometimes it can be uncomfortable to talk about the degree to which are experiencing diarrhea, but cannot stress enough that they really do need to know. And oftentimes medications can help, but there are dietary changes that can be made. We'll frequently recommend what we call the BRAT diet. B bananas, R rice, A, applesauce, T, toast and kind of slowly introducing those agents back into your diet can sometimes be helpful in controlling the amount of diarrhea you're experiencing. Introducing small bits of liquids. Again, you should be able to hold some of these agents in as far as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. So wanting to make sure that you keep in contact with your provider if you can't, but there are these dietary modifications you can, that should help, and if they don't seeking attention.</Content>

<Content id="0">So there are pharmacologic agents that can help. Always making sure that you have a prescription for these antiemetics on hand. As far as non-pharmacologic options, small frequent meals, usually bland meals, tepid in temperature. Anything too warm, too cold, might aggravate that nausea. Anything with lots of flavor, unfortunately, may aggravate the nausea so we'll recommend small frequent meals. Sometimes we'll hear that actually using flatware, the metal can actually aggravate nausea and sometimes using plastic utensils can help things like that. As far as fluids, again, room temperature, little bits at a time, these things can help. But of course being aware of if you're not able to keep anything down and seeking attention.</Content>

<Content id="0">I have seen more times than I can count, patients who end up admitted to the hospital because they didn't want to bother the provider, the nurse practitioner, whoever is working with them. You know, the bottom line is, if it's bothersome to you or if it's out of the ordinary for you, it needs to be reported. A good rule of thumb is let your healthcare provider decide if it's something that needs to be intervened upon. That should not be on you.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">It can often become hard to get out of bed and sometimes just getting off of the couch seems like in an enormous task, and that's not normal.  </BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Unfortunately, fatigue is a very common side effect of most chemotherapeutic agents. And it can often become hard just to get out of bed and sometimes just getting off of the couch seems like in an enormous task, and that's not normal. †You will have some degree of energy loss with chemotherapy, but you know, to find yourself challenged to, you know, get out of a chair, go to the bathroom, walk a flight of steps, these are the things that would indicate that perhaps your fatigue is at a higher level than what we would call normal. We can recommend things like energy conservation and trying to kind of group your tasks, so that you can get more prolonged periods of rest throughout the day. †But these are, it's something you want to be aware of, you know if you're finding yourself sleeping more than usual and finding yourself getting short of breath and having chest pain with any type of activity this could be a sign that you are having some level of anemia from your chemotherapy and anemia really does aggravate the chemotherapy associated fatigue that we can see.</Content>

<Content id="0">It's very important to track anything you experience once you start these drugs. I very often will recommend keeping some kind of diary, whether it's electronic or on paper. You know, what did you experience today? How many times did you have to use the bathroom? What were you able to eat or drink? So that you can kind of track and see, you know, how do I feel this day versus the next day? But it's very important to be aware of how your body's responding to the drugs that you're on, so that you can seek care at the earliest point possible if intervention needs to be taken.</Content>

Not to the degree that it's interfering with your quality-of-life or possibly aggravating other symptoms. So never hesitate to talk with your healthcare provider about that. There may be another physical reason in addition to side effects. Like I said, you could have some level of anemia or something that we can do to correct that to improve your energy level.</Content>

<Content id="0">I would also suggest leaning on your family and caregiver support system. Involving them in the psychosocial issues you're needing to cope with and seeking support from them. Support from patients going through similar treatments, patients who are at varying stages of the cancer trajectory. Ranging from maybe just starting treatment like they are, all the way through to beating the disease and in the survivorship stage. Seeking support groups, whether in person, there are a variety of online support groups. Now there is no shortage of support groups that can help.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Constipation can be just as problematic as diarrhea when you're on chemotherapy.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Constipation can be just as problematic as diarrhea when you're on chemotherapy and something to also alert your healthcare provider if you're experiencing severe constipation things like abdominal cramping. †Some of the strategies you can take will obviously you know promote a bowel regimen things like a softener or laxative can be pretty mild not a lot of side effects and often times very effective in helping chemotherapy related constipation. Increasing your oral intake can certainly help. Increasing mobility can help with constipation. So these are all things that you can do on your own to try to help alleviate some of the constipation, but it's just as important to make sure you're talking to your healthcare provider about the possibility of needing a bowel regimen and when to seek attention. Because there are some chemotherapeutic agents that can cause obstruction, so it's not something you want to overlook. So an obstruction would be almost like a fecal impaction and you become so constipated and full of stool that you can have a back-up through the gastrointestinal system and it can cause some pretty serious complications within your small bowel or large bowel. It can often require hospitalization while we have to what we called decompress the bowel, so all that to say, it's not something that you want to take lightly. It's important to know what your normal is, so that if you notice a change from your normal bowel movement patterns you can discuss that with your healthcare provider.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">It's very important to stick to the schedule that your healthcare provider gives you for your pain medications.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">One of the most common mistakes I can see is when somebody, a patient, maybe is not experiencing pain and they think I don't really need my opioids. I don't need to take my pain medications. Having a great day, don't need it and then they actually will experience pain pretty severely after taking a little break from the pain medication. †So it's very important to stick to the schedule that your healthcare provider gives you for your pain medications to keep your pain at bay, regardless of your pain level. Of course, if you experience an increase in pain and you're noticing that the medications aren't as effective you'll want to check in with your healthcare provider and make the adjustments necessary. But very important to stay on the schedule that you're healthcare provider gives you.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">I really can't stress enough how important it is if you're on any type of oral chemotherapy to fairly regularly take a look at your skin.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Skin issues while on oral agents for chemotherapy become very important. There are some chemotherapy drugs with which rashes and skin changes can be expected and in some cases mean that the drug is actually working. That's just some agents. So any rashes, any new skin reactions that you notice really should be directed, brought to the attention of your healthcare provider so that decisions can be made about the proper topical treatment, if necessary, any breaks in the drug that might be required. So I really can't stress enough how important it is if you're on any type of oral chemotherapy to fairly regularly take a look at your skin. Even the parts that maybe you can't see, on the back. And be aware of any changes, any new rashes and to let your healthcare provider know about them as soon as you notice them. Sometimes they can become so irritating and so debilitating that patients will sometimes just stop taking them because they're just so irritated, but then we can see, you know that possibly that was an indication of that the drug was working and it is very important when you're on oral agents to really adhere to the prescribed frequency. And any changes from that can really have an impact on the efficacy of the drug, so really letting the decision to hold or change doses really be up to your treating physician.</Content>

<Content id="0">With chemotherapy it's really important to take good care of the skin in general. †Keep the skin clean and moisturized. If you go into the sun make sure that you're wearing a good sunscreen, but it's also important that if a rash becomes significant to the point where it's bothering a patient and making them not want to take their chemo anymore that they're in touch with their healthcare provider. And this is extremely important because they found actually a relationship between certain types of chemotherapy and the presence of a rash. In other words the rash says that it's working to a certain degree with some types of chemo, so to let the healthcare provider know what you're experiencing but not necessarily stop or change your drug prescription in any way without their permission and their guidance.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">It's important to ensure that even if you do have some Microsites or some sores in the mouth continue to eat and drink normally.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Chemotherapy can kill off the rapidly dividing cells in the mouth and along the G.I. tract and it's important to keep the mouth clean and moist. Rinsing with just some water or some weak saline, just a teaspoon of salt in a cup of water for example, is the least expensive very easy fix. To just rinse and spit on a regular basis, say four times the day. Keeping your teeth brushed, but not overly so. You don't want your gums to bleed or anything along that line. It's okay to floss as long as your platelet count and your white blood cell count are not in a dangerous zone and to probably avoid spicy foods a lot of times or anything really salty that would cause even more discomfort in the oral cavity. Mucositis can get very severe, but it really depends on the type of treatment that someone receives. Certain chemotherapies do tend to cause just a small sore in the mouth like somebody would describe it as a canker sore something simple like that which can still be painful and bothersome, but not necessarily keep someone from eating normally and drinking normally. It's important to ensure that even if you do have some mucositis or some sores in the mouth continue to eat and drink normally. If you're not able to eat and drink fully contact the healthcare provider because that's when you need to make sure that you got enough fluid so you're not becoming dehydrated.</Content>

<Content id="0">A lot of patients do complain of memory loss and forgetfulness and not necessarily confusion, but they just don't feel like they have their full selves there. A lot of times it's attributed to stress and lack of sleep, fatigue in general. All of that can occur. You can also have some changes within the brain from the chemotherapy itself, but every person is a little bit different and people use a lot of different tricks to help them remember things. A lot of people will write notes and have Post its all over the place. And to make sure they write things down when you go to the doctor's office or when you're visiting or calling your healthcare provider. Write everything down because you're not going to remember it whether it's due to stress or chemotherapy. It's very common to forget things frequently.</Content>

<Content id="0">Many people have sleep disturbances and they can be related again to the stress of overall treatment and the stress of life when you're trying to go through treatment. To provide what they call sleep hygiene, providing a darkened room to sleep that's a little bit on the cooler side will help some people. Making sure that you get some exercise, some fresh air during the day. Try not to watch TV before going to sleep or anything that will kind of keep the brain busy before you go to sleep.

<BaseQuestion id="0">If there's anything that's keeping someone from taking their medications as prescribed it really does need to be communicated to the healthcare team.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">One of the most important things about taking oral anti-cancer drugs is to make sure that they're actually taken as prescribed. It's sometimes very challenging to get the drugs from the pharmacy initially because many of the pharmacies, many of the drugs, need to be ordered from specialty pharmacies and they might be received in the mail rather than just picking it up at your local store as you would with the rest of the prescriptions. †But it's extremely important if you don't get them when you're supposed to, notify the healthcare team. †And if there's anything that's keeping someone from taking their medications as prescribed it really does need to be communicated to the healthcare team. The way that the oral chemotherapies work is they build up a certain blood level of the drug and that's what's effective against the cancer and to skip a dose or to try to double up if you skipped a dose anything like that will actually cause more harm than good. †So it's really very, very important to always take the chemotherapy drugs on schedule as prescribed. If they need to be taken with food for example or without food for example make sure you have those instructions ahead of time so that can be so you can follow the instructions as, as you were given and if there's something if something happens to prevent you from taking it as prescribed you should notify the prescriber to make sure that they know how much you've taken and why things might be changing.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">When you do find that healthcare provider you are comfortable speaking with remember that they have heard it before.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The Loss of sexual desire after chemotherapy is a common side effect and it can be quite difficult to converse with your healthcare provider about that issue. My advice would be to be open, to be honest. Find a Healthcare provider that you're comfortable talking to, whether it is male or female, and openly discuss your issues so they can help you to the best of their ability. When you do find that healthcare provider you are comfortable speaking with remember that they have heard it before and they will be doing their best to find the best outcome for you. One other suggestion I would make is that a lot of oncology practices and centers are offering the ability for patients to email in question so if you're more comfortable with writing your issue instead of discussing it verbally that may be one option for you as well. One thing to remember too is that if you're having a sexual problem following chemotherapy or following radiation treatment whatever it may be chances are someone else has had the same problem and that's why I say healthcare provider will do their best to find you the best outcome. There's also, a good idea is to find a support group that deals with a specific issue or just issues in general where you can discuss the problem, maybe one on one with someone or in a group setting with people that are have these same kind of problems you're having.</Content>

<Content id="0">One side effect of some chemotherapy agents, not all of them, can be some cardiac or heart problems. It's very important first of all to let your healthcare provider, your oncologist your nurse know if you have a history of any kind of heart problem because that can compound the issue. And if you do have a history of any kind of heart problem they can maybe tailor your treatment or monitor you a little more closely for those side effects. Some of the problems that can happen can be an irregular heartbeat. Some palpitations, some people refer to them as a murmur. If you have a history of heart failure you probably know what those symptoms are with fluid retention and swelling of your feet and ankles, maybe some cloudiness in your head and of course if you have any type of what you may think of as heart attack symptoms it's very important to call 911 or get to an emergency room right away. Such as chest pain, chest pressure, any pain maybe that will go down your left arm that would be associated in addition to the chest pain or pressure that you might be having, so that's very important to remember.</Content>

<Content id="0">The side effect of peripheral neuropathy can be quite distressing for patients and what I want to encourage you to do is report any symptoms of tingling, numbness, difficulty buttoning your clothes, difficulty dialing a phone, difficulty typing on the computer keyboard. †Those are very important symptoms that could potentially point to peripheral neuropathy and that you need to let your healthcare provider know. It may affect your treatment dose your treatment dose may need to be reduced or may not but they need to keep monitoring the symptoms and you need to keep reporting them. It's important not to hide those because you think your dose might be reduced because of them because they can get worse. So you need to make sure that you keep on top of them and report them to your healthcare provider. One thing about peripheral neuropathy that it's important to remember is that it can be reversible or can be irreversible. †If it is irreversible it may be permanent for the rest of your life, so it is something monitor, something to watch as you move through your survivorship days because you could have difficulty in feeling temperature changes that's something that's very important when you're taking a bath, when you're taking a shower, when you're washing dishes, when you doing laundry, when you're shoveling snow. The hot and cold temperatures can make a difference and you could actually have some damage to your skin because you may not feel the temperature change because of the peripheral neuropathy. It can also cause a lot of pain, it can also cause tingling and numbness to come and go and your fingers your toes really any of your extremities arms legs. †So it's important again to monitor those and report those to your healthcare provider whether it be your primary care physician or your oncologist.</Content>

You know what your body is usually like and any change in your vision, any change in how your eyes feel, you need to report those. Sometimes you can treat them on your own. Dry eyes, you can try artificial tears. †But it can be a problem that goes beyond what artificial tears or something else might be able to do. So you would need to contact your physician. Maybe they would recommend going to see an eye doctor about that problem, but again important to contact your healthcare provider if it's something that's very bothersome and you're unable to control or treat on your own.</Content>

<Content id="0">As far as eating and drinking and making sure your dietary components are where they should be. First and foremost, when you're taking oral chemotherapy you should ask if there's any restrictions to your diet to make sure there's no contraindications, meaning there might be a certain food or drink or supplement that you're taking that might interfere with your treatment. So you want to make sure that there's nothing you usually eat, drink or take that might interfere with your treatment and cause it to maybe have more side effects or to maybe even not work as well as it should work. †That's important. †It's also very important to keep up your nutritional status. There is usually, if not always, some way to get hold of a dietician or a nutritionist through your oncologist office. They should all have a contact with a nutritionist or dietician and they can help you with meal planning if you are concerned about eating too much or that you've been eating too little. They can help you with supplements, meaning the liquid supplements for extra calories or maybe even to help you to round out your diet if it is missing something because you are unable to take in certain nutrients that you might need.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Look into getting a referral to a cosmetologist who works with cancer patients who can help you with selecting a wig.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">One concern or fear of chemotherapy is loss of hair and many times this affects women differently than man. †What's important is to ask before you start your treatment if this will cause hair loss, if you're treatment will cause hair loss and what type of hair loss that will cause. Sometimes it's partial; sometimes it's full hair loss, and if that's a concern to you, you, need to ask for, or look into getting a referral to a cosmetologist who works with cancer patients who can help you with selecting a wig, making changes to that wig to make it look as much like your hair as possible. †If a cosmetologist is not an option for you, maybe financially, the American Cancer Society or maybe another organization that offers hair prosthesis, as they call them, or wigs to cancer patients would be an option for you. Many times those services are free. They may not have a high-level cosmetologist available to help you, but at least it would be a start for you and you wouldn't have to go without some kind of hair covering or wig or prosthesis whatever you want to call it throughout your treatment that you would get some support you would get some help with that and always remember your hair is going to grow back. †And the regrowth of your hair, when it happens, will usually start maybe a month or so after your treatment finishes sometimes patients even have a little bit to regrowth in between treatments and sometimes your hair can be completely different when it grows back. For instance, if you used to color your hair and you know you had some grey hair it's probably going to come in pretty gray or it could come back curly when you really had straight hair before. Most of the time that texture goes back to normal at some point once your hair really starts coming back in but not always so there can be a change in texture change in color and be aware that it may look quite different than your previous head of hair. When you'll lose your hair will vary depending on the treatment that you're taking sometimes it will fall out within a week or so the first treatment sometimes it takes three or four weeks sometimes it's with the second and third treatment cycle of treatment month of treatment before you'll see much hair loss at all and again not every drug will cause hair loss.</Content>

<Content id="0">Sometimes chemotherapy patients may develop blood clots in their legs and this is can be a very serious side effect or very serious complication of treatment, so it's important to know the signs and symptoms and know how to prevent them. Prevention, keep active, don't stay sedentary, however if you do start feeling some pain in your legs, some pressure in your leg, noticed some swelling in your leg or both legs that would be an indication that you need to contact your physician. Especially if it's swelling that doesn't go away. If its pain that doesn't go away when you sit down and elevate your legs and that would be another way to determine if it's really important to call your physician is If you do sit down and elevate your leg and the pain doesn't go away, the swelling doesn't go away. If you have a more sedentary lifestyle or you're more inactive because maybe you're experiencing some fatigue it's still important to get some exercise whether it be if you're lying in bed you can roll your ankles around, you can lift your feet up and down, you can move them around just to keep your circulation going very well. †If you're traveling whether it be in the car, whether it be in a plane, it's important, if you're driving a car to take some frequent rest stops get up walk around and keep that circulation going. On the plane you can sit in your seat and again lift your legs, roll your ankles, extend your feet up and down and that will be very helpful in preventing swelling as well as a blood clot or thrombosis as it's called.</Content>

<Content id="0">Communicating with your healthcare provider about any issues or concerns or just any questions you may have is extremely important. Maybe something you forgot to ask during an appointment comes into your head and one thing to ask or to remember is that most oncology offices at this point have some way to electronically contact patients. Whether it be through an email address, a text message system, even just a phone call to the nurses. And many of them have 24-hour availability to be able to contact. I'm not saying that you should contact them with every little question, but it is an option if you forget to ask something, if you have a real concern, if you're not sure if you should come in for an appointment. That's a really good way to get a hold of them and ask out right, "Here's what's happening, Do I need to come do I not need to come in." And you'd probably get a faster response that way than calling in and waiting for a call back later in the day or the following day.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Cancer care is an expensive disease.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Cancer care is an expensive disease and it's in the headlines quite a bit in terms of the rapidly rising cost, not only in terms of treatment costs, but the out-of-pocket costs for families. This is particularly acute in terms of oral agents and that is getting much more attention. The way in which coverage pays for medications differs between intravenous therapy the patients will receive in the hospital, or in their physician's office, or an infusion center, versus getting a pill, which they will be able to take at home. And there is a discrepancy between those costs and the oral agents. Many of them today are quite expensive. They can be tens of thousands of dollars, in fact some can be as much a hundred thousand dollars a year, and that's partly related to the reimbursement for those medications.</Content>

<Content id="0">The way in which chemotherapy medications are covered in insurance plans varies. And, because of that we are finding issues with patients continuing to take their oral medications. Because oral medications are under the prescription plan of the plan. So, if you think about Medicare, Medicare Part D is the prescription plan that people who are eligible for Medicare subscribe to. Depending on the plan which a person chooses when they become a patient can make a difference in terms of how much they are going to be responsible for paying. Again in the case of Medicare, Medicare Part A is the hospital coverage. Medicare Part B is the physician or the outpatient coverage. And that's where the drugs that are given intravenously are administered. And, there, again there's co-pay there, but there's much better coverage in those cases. That is also true with other kinds of insurance. Certainly people who are under 25 develop cancer and have treatment for cancer and some of the cancers they have are being treated more and more with what we call oral agents, with pills, and that is causing more hardship for families in terms of what they're responsible for paying.</Content>

<Content id="0">You know something that nurses hear quite regularly from patients when they are prescribed oral agents and learn what those, the cost of those agents are going to be, is that they're facing choices. While there may be the convenience of having a pill and not having to go to a cancer center or a physician, hospital, a physician practice or a hospital, they are often faced with, "If I have to pay this amount for this drug, what is it going to do to my grocery budget? What is that going to do to my mortgage payment or my rent or any of the other routine expenses that we have in our daily life?" And, so patients often are faced with those difficult decisions. Some may make the decision that they are going to use up their savings for retirement or that are taking care of them in retirement. Some may borrow against any of retirement plans they have.

<BaseQuestion id="0">If the oral agent is really equivalent to the infusion agent and in terms of efficacy and outcome, the decision maybe then to continue the intravenous agent although there is an oral agent alternative.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Well, Medicare choosing is certainly a challenge in terms of Medicare Part D. I think Medicare Part A and B often times the patient really is choosing between traditional Medicare, or the Medicare Advantage programs. But when it comes to the prescription plan, the Medicare Part D, there are any number of options that the patients have. And, each option may cover different things. And at the time that a person is choosing those plans they may not have a cancer diagnosis, and so when they look at what the premium will be for that Part D, they may not be thinking in terms of the what if; "What if I have cancer?" And, certainly may choose a low-cost plan that has limited formulary, limited list of medications. And, then once they have a diagnosis of cancer they may even find that from year-to-year they may have to look very carefully because even if this year's choice has their drug on the list, next year's choice may not. And, they may have to switch to a different plan. So, once they have a cancer diagnosis, if they are on oral agents, they have to look very carefully at the Part D plans. So let's take the example of somebody who has been on intravenous chemotherapy and is now being changed to an oral agent. They may have been, they would probably have been, being covered under Medicare because of part A or B, depending on whether they were getting the chemo in the hospital or in a physician's infusion practice. But, if it's now an oral agent, they may be part way into their Part D insurance coverage, and the agent that the physician wants to move them to may not be covered. That does lead to some interesting dilemmas as well. Because if the oral agent is really equivalent to the infusion agent and in terms of efficacy and outcome, the decision maybe then to continue the intravenous agent, although there is an oral agent alternative.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">While there still is somewhat of a donut hole, that is closing and it will continue to close</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">You know one of the things that, certainly in the earliest years of Medicare Part D, that was quite a shock, I think, to many seniors who went on Part D was the infamous donut hole. And while there still is somewhat of a donut hole, that is closing and it will continue to close, but that was a combination of reaching your limit of deductible, reaching a certain amount in terms of your co-pays, and then in the donut hole you will be uncovered, and then having to get to another total expenditure to get coverage again. So it was a certain amount of coverage and your own expense and then going basically uncovered for a period of time and then back to coverage.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Medicare may not pay at all for those medications if they're off label use.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">In cancer care it's not unusual that a cancer drug, which often times these drugs take 17 years to get from discovery to when they are available as a standard treatment, and so when people are, when the FDA approves, when the FDA approves a drug by the time it gets to the point from that discovery to being approved as standard treatment, typically it's then for a limited disease or a limited number of diseases. But, what we know is that sometimes these drugs are beneficial in other cancers, but those cancers have not been part of a clinical trial and the clinical trial part of this whole development of drugs is very important in leading into the FDA approval. So, now we may have a situation where a physician feels a particular drug or combination of drugs would be beneficial for a certain patient with a certain disease and those drugs are not on label use, it can be very beneficial, but Medicare may not pay at all for those medications, if they're off label use. That's also true of other payers. In fact, it's not uncommon with other payers because they look at this and think, "Well it's an experimental use," and they don't look at it as the standard and don't look at it as being covered.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">There is a bill in Congress it has not been passed and what we know is until that's passed the true impact is not going to be felt.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Over the last few years, particularly as we see an increase number of oral agents be developed and come onto the market, the issue of parity with intravenous chemotherapy has become, and because of the cost of the oral agents, this has become quite a policy and political issue, both at the national as well as at the state level. We have many many states that have, probably over half of our states, have approved parity which says if an insurance plan covers intravenous drugs it should also be covering, equitably, the oral agent as well. The federal law has not passed. There is a law, there is a bill in Congress. It has not been passed, and what we know is until that's passed really true impact is not going to be felt. Because, the states, what they regulate, it doesn't impact the largest payer in this country which is Medicare. And, many of the private payers follow, then, the Medicare lead. So, the national bill, if that gets approved, will be very important to watch then what happens.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Let the healthcare team know that they're struggling in terms of financial impact of the treatment.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">You know if patients are in a situation where they find themselves struggling in terms of the cost of their cancer treatment. Particularly if it's an oral agent, they should not try to solve that by themselves by cutting the pill in half or taking it less frequently or stopping some other medication. The first thing that the patient should do is address this when they go in for a visit, or, if they're not scheduled for a visit, to make a visit to let the healthcare team know that they're struggling in terms of financial impact of the treatment. And, to work with the healthcare team on what possible solutions there are, whether that might be submitting an application for support from a pharmaceutical agent, whether it's looking at their whole medication profile and looking; do they happen to have the option for generics and some other kinds of medicines that might be lower-cost? But, they shouldn't try and solve it themselves by anything that would alter the way in which the medication was prescribed because they won't get the benefit from the treatment. You know many of the pharmaceutical companies are recognizing, and they have for years, that with the cost of treatment there might be patients who are unable to pay for the treatments that they need and that it would be tremendously beneficial to them. So, many of the pharmaceutical companies have programs with reduced cost of access for the medications. And, there's a process and the process begins with the provider and, whether it's in the physician's office or the hospital-based clinic, and an appeal; basically an application process to the particular pharmaceutical company that provides the drug, in that they process that, and it's needs based so there is an application that has to occur.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Things like risk for infection, gastrointestinal side effects, these can all be relatively normal or relatively expected side effects</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Well, there are such a variety of side effects we can see with oral agents. Some of the most common that you might see, Myelosuppression, or causing your bone marrow to not make normal cells or the amount that they normally would make. So things that you can see from that are your white blood cell counts can drop. Your white blood cells are what fight infection, so we can see patients become very prone to infection as they're on any type of chemotherapy including oral agents. Becomes very important to monitor if you're having a fever, and let your healthcare provider know as soon as you start to experience a possible even low-grade fever. Usually our cut off is around 100.4. You can also see, as your platelet counts drop, some bruising. You can bleed more easily than you normally would. Also, things to let your healthcare provider know about. Gastrointestinal side effects can be just as common with oral agents so things like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea you'd want to let your healthcare provider know. If you're not able to take anything in orally either food or beverage. That's not normal. You need to be able to keep some degree of food or beverages down. Diarrhea. Good thing to talk to your healthcare provider about. We usually track it in terms of how frequently you're going every day and what would a normal increase in that be. Along the lines of gastrointestinal side effects, we can see mouth sores that are a portal of entry for bacteria, can cause infections, painful swallowing, all of these things are common side effects, but ones that would require letting your healthcare provider know about. So things like risk for infection, gastrointestinal side effects, these can all be relatively normal or relatively expected side effects. Skin reactions. We can see rashes develop pretty much anywhere but especially the hands and feet. That would also be something you let healthcare provider know about.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">I think part of it was psychological because I knew I was putting, in my mind; poison into my body.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">I felt somewhat unprepared to take this oral med. And I started off with three pills in the morning, three pills in the evening. And the pills are like these monster, to me in my mind, seem like these monstrous, and I would choke on them when I was trying to take them. I think part of it was psychological because I knew I was putting, in my mind; poison into my body and so that took a while to get adjusted to. When I asked, "Does it come in a liquid form, can I do anything else?" They said, "No it's only this horse pill, that there is nothing we can change." I guess part of it is just suck it up and take it. I know this sounds harsh, but it's the only thing right now keeping my cancer from growing, so I just take my time and I take one at a time. And I think some of it is psychological, but I think there is a true physical component to it. They're bigger pills and it's hard for me to swallow them. So it's gotten better. It's gotten a lot better because I think I've come to realize in my head that, "Liz, they can't change anything and they can't give it to you in a liquid form you just have to suck it up."</Content>

<Content id="0">With the IV you are just so sick and I took pills to have handle the nausea. I was on all these different things and I ended up in the hospital for eight days because I had all kinds of side effects, and my pressure was low, and I mean it was really a nightmare. So I knew I didn't want to go back on the IV stuff if at all possible. If he would have said, "Look, you need another round of IV," I would have whined about it, but I would have gotten it, but that's not the case. It was very attractive to me that there was the option of using an oral chemo drug, so even though it's tough to take it, I feel good about taking it and I would hope that others are able to see the powerful chemo drug but you're not getting all the side effects that you get from the IV chemotherapy.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">I actually went to the website for the drug and looked a lot of stuff up there.  </BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The way I found out about a lot of the information related to the oral drug I am taking was the Internet. You have to distinguish between what's fact and what a bunch of baloney that's out there, so you have to be really careful when you look at these websites. I actually went to the website for the drug and looked a lot of stuff up there. When I was with my first oncologist and she suggested this oral drug, they gave me like a packet of information and that sort of thing. She didn't really explain anything, but she gave me the packet of information to take home and look through it. I really wasn't given many instructions. My caregiver, my husband, he did some research on the internet as well, plus the little fold out paper that you get with the drug, there's a lot of information there. And you know that it's decent information because if it was false, hopefully, it wouldn't be in that little paper that comes with it. So I read through that. Some of my colleagues at work explained to me a little about the drug, and about how you have to store it, and I have to be careful with it. Do a lot of it, I think, I learned on my own.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">I really found relief from the pity parties. While I still have them, they're not nearly as drastic as they were in the past.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">I have had some times where I feel really sad, and I feel sorry for myself and don't want to get out of bed and that sort of thing. But the physician put me on an antidepressant and that has helped tremendously. Again, I don't feel like I'm crazy, or I'm going to go out and do something crazy. But I think it's just enough to help me deal with the emotional roller coaster. Because that's what it is, really. One minute you're happy and you've done everything you could, and then the next minute bam something slams into your face and all of a sudden you have a whole new battle which, that was that was very, very hard for me to adjust to that new battle each time it's happened. I would definitely encourage other patients to consider using an antidepressant, and I think there are a lot of negative comments about, "Well you must be crazy." "You're on an antidepressant." And that's not the case. I really found relief from the pity parties. While I still have them, they're not nearly as drastic as they were in the past. So I think it's a good thing to go on this. Nobody needs to know that you're taking it, well except the whole world now that I'm saying it. You can take the drug without feeling; you should be able to take the drug without feeling guilty, and it's helped me immensely. And it's actually okay to have some pity parties because there are times where you just want to, "Forget it, I'm not doing this anymore I just want to go back to my old life." Well that's never going to happen, so the fact that I have to take this drug more than likely the rest of my life, I just have to get used to that change.</Content>

<Content id="0">From a social standpoint I am very, very blessed to number one have a fantastic family who has helped me immensely. My son makes me breakfast, or he'll make me something for lunch when he's not at work. I mean they've been tremendous. I've also had a lot of friends that have sent cards and books and scarves, and it's been really wonderful to see who your friends really are. Because when something this drastic happens, I've one friend that I haven't heard from the entire time, and she knows what's going on because I put the stuff on Facebook and I haven't heard from her at all. And I was really, really disappointed by that. But again it just shows you who you can count on and who you can't. I know who I can count on. I also use a service that I can I can post an update on what I'm doing and then my friends will subscribe to that website or webpage. I'm not sure exactly how it works, but when I send an update it goes out to everybody that subscribed because I don't really want to get on the phone and talk to a hundred people. I want to tell one person and that person can kind of divide up the story. And that's helped a lot.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">There may be a little things that nobody picks up that that nurse will see and then go back to the physician and sale I'm concerned because Liz has this this and this going on.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">I would suggest to other patients that are going through this that communication is really the key because sometimes what happens is you're seeing so many doctors and you're doing silly things it's really hard to keep all that straight. And sometimes the doctor will come in and say okay you have this this and this and walk out the door. It's the nurse, again my experience, it's the nurses who are the ones actually sit down with you and say, "Okay here's what you should do, take this. If you start to feel nauseous take this anti-nausea drug." And she is the one that explains a lot of things to me. So communicating back to your physician and having the physician or most in most cases be the nurse are the ones then will call you to check in, "Hey I know you started this new medicine. How are you feeling? Do you need anything else?" If I need something related to insurance, bam, she's first person I call. If I have major side effects that I don't think I can deal with on my own, I call her and it can be anytime, weekends, middle of the night. There are ones that you can ask questions about that want to give you the reassurance that you need, and they're the ones that will relay information back to the physician and then once she's talking to the physician. And once she talks to the physician, she then relays that information to me. There may be a little things that nobody picks up that that nurse will see and then go back to the physician and say, I'm concerned because Liz has this, this and this going on. And so then there's the communication between the nurse and me, between the nurse and the physician, and then between physician and me, so we can have a threesome going there.</Content>

<Content id="0">Certain types of chemotherapy, oral chemotherapy and intravenous chemotherapy can cause something called hand- foot syndrome. And that can be just some sensitive areas around the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet and it can just be sensitive or it can evolve into some blisters that are actually noticeable blisters and they can be quite painful. Keeping the hands clean, moist and the soles of the feet clean and moist, again with just a regular moisturizer, it doesn't have to be anything fancy. And try to avoid anything constricting. No tight shoes, no tight gloves. Let the circulation in that area flow freely.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">It was cold. It was winter, so I wore a lot of hats.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Well, when I lost my hair for the first round of chemo. It was cold. It was winter, so I wore a lot of hats. I wore the scarf once in a while. But I thought about the whole wig thing, but then I thought well this is going to be over soon and I don't really need to pay 500 hundred dollars for a wig that I might never use. So I didn't go and get one, although people had given me information about where you could go, who you could talk to, that sort of thing. I decided I didn't need it. I had these hats on. My daughter was a student at Penn State. I had this Penn State hat which was pretty silly looking. It had these fake braid things that come down. That thing was the warmest thing I ever wore. I wore it around the house. I wore it when I went out. I always had this dang thing on, but it was so warm. It came down over my ears and, because you're right, when you lose your hair you're freezing all the time. Especially, as they say with babies they lose a lot of heat through their scalp, well adult patients do too, and I was just cold all the time. When my hair grew back in, it was this dark color because this is my natural color, this brown. So many people knew me as a blond because I had highlights in my hair for quite a while. So as people were seeing me for the first time like, "holy cow you have brown hair." "Yeah, it's kind of what I was born with, the brown hair." Then I had a whole bunch of grey hair in the front. I let it grown in to the point I couldn't take it. "Get this grey out of here. Dye it, do whatever you need to do." So she colored my hair my natural color, but got all that grey, which is starting to come back, don't tell anybody, but that was very, very helpful. When my hair started growing back it was these little ringlet curls and I used to pay big money when I had big hair back in the 80s to get my hair permed. Well, this I don't know if you can tell, it's all natural curl, it grew in with all these curls. "Wow, this is amazing." So I was quite surprised by that.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">You're just overwhelmed. If you do three things then you have to sit down and take a rest.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Mr. F., Fatigue. That sucker is always with me it feels like. When I was on the chemo IV, I was tired; but I wasn't really doing a whole lot to feel exhausted. Now that I'm on the oral drug I'm doing more and it's this feeling of complete exhaustion. Like I will be sitting there looking at something on email and I'll fall asleep or I'll be reading the newspaper and I'll fall sleep. I mean it's just, it's overwhelming. Yesterday I didn't get out of bed till noon and I slept that whole time. It wasn't like I went back to bed or anything like that, and I had a very sound sleep until I looked at the clock and I'm like, "Oh my god it's noon I've got to get up." So I think that between the nausea and the fatigue, those are probably the two biggest things that... I was afraid of the nausea because I didn't want to be throwing up all the time, so I would take these pills to make it so I don't throw up. The fatigue is just... You're just overwhelmed. If you do three things then you have to sit down and take a rest. Like most of the time I would take a nap in the afternoon and I was never a nap person and at first it was. "Oh Liz, if you take a nap you'll never sleep at night you shouldn't do that." Where I could take a nap and still sleep eight hours a night.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">At first I was like "are you kidding me?" I'm tired why would I want to go for a walk?  </BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">What did I do for the fatigue, well I started walking which the Oncology Nursing Society has a lot of information about how exercise whatever you choose to do, walk, treadmill, whatever happens to be really, really helps with the fatigue. At first I was like "are you kidding me", I'm tired why would I want to go for a walk that just doesn't sound right. But before I started, in the interim where I wasn't on any chemo drugs I started to walk and I was up to 5 miles a day which I didn't walk that much when I was healthy so it was really, really exciting to be able to walk that far. Once all the other stuff started going on, the drain and all that business, I haven't been walking as far, but I'm walking a little bit and I keep track of it on my fit bit so that way I can see how many steps I've taken how many miles I've walked and that sort of thing. And actually walking for as much as I hate when they're right it actually did help with fatigue it was still there but it wasn't as intense. For instance yesterday I was I was really, really dizzy and I didn't want to go on a walk if I was ready to pass out, so my husband went with me the day before and yesterday I just I couldn't go anywhere I was just way too tired, but today I'm at work and so far so good I haven't fallen asleep anywhere. I was in a meeting a couple months ago with my CEO and some of the other staff. We have this basic meeting and I kept falling asleep and it's only an hour meeting. I could not stay awake and people said to me "Liz we can't stay awake and we're not on anything else". And the CEO was looking right at me, like oh my God she knows I'm falling asleep and I have to listen. Well then the next meeting I volunteered to be the scribe. So that forced me to stand up, which forced me to stay awake, so I think you find ways. Each person is different, so what may be helpful for me isn't necessarily helpful for another patient that has cancer, but you kind of have to have base it on, well I've tried this and it doesn't really work let's try something else.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">It really made a difference for me psychologically to be able to get out of bed, get up early, put my big girl clothes on and go to work.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">For me going back to work is very, very positive, because my work was my normal life. You know I get up, go to work all day, drive home and you're done. And being at the office makes me feel quote "normal", that I don't have cancer. I don't have to take a million pills because I take them at home. I don't have to take anything here. And it really made a difference for me psychologically to be able to get out of bed, get up early, put my big girl clothes on and go to work. Even at home, like when my kids graduated from college I was able to go to their graduations and not be as worried about fatigue because they were just so happy to see me there. And I barely had any hair at one point and we're taking pictures. Again it's that normal that I would've done even if I wasn't sick, to go and watch my kids graduate from college. It's a good feeling to be at work. There are a lot of people here that have been extremely supportive of me and they even, when I come in to the office, oh everybody comes and, "Liz you look so great" and they give me hugs and to me that is so, so valuable.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">It depends on what kind of a relationship you have with your coworkers.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Would I recommend telling co-workers? I think in my situation, yes I would. It depends on what kind of a relationship you have with your coworkers. I think for me it's been so positive because people have been very, very supportive. Now if you work in an environment that really doesn't support the whole "you're sick and you're going to miss time" then it might not a good idea to share too much with your employer especially if that person or group isn't providing anything positive to you. So I think, it's, I think it's hit or miss. If you if you think that you can tell people at work, if you think that'll make it easier for you, then you might want to consider that. If you don't feel comfortable talking to somebody at work then maybe you can go to a psychologist. Again it's not bad to do that. I've gone once I haven't got back yet, but again, it's kind of this third-party that doesn't know anything about you that you can just go get your feelings out express what your concerns are and really take care of you as a person and not just of the disease.</Content>

<Content id="0">With the oral drug though there are some side effects. With this particular drug you get blisters on your feet, and I won't show my feet cause they are disgusting looking. You get blisters on your feet, and you get like you're the ball of your foot and your heel get really sensitive and it makes it hard to walk because you have pain, and it's not traditional neuropathy, but it's very, very close to that. My hands have been fine, again knock on wood. I haven't had any kind of ulcers†or anything like that. So, for my feet they recommend that you put lotion on five times a day. I don't have time for that. So I put it on whenever I think about it. It's usually in the morning after I take a shower and at night before I go to bed. I just lather them up with this stuff that I have. And right now, since I have that week off, my feet are fine. There's a little bit of peeling, but what I had the last time was even in between my toes. It was kind of disgusting actually. It was more an inconvenience at times because I wanted to go for a walk, but I couldn't because my feet were so sore. So that's probably one big side effect that I guess I didn't anticipate. But the best thing you can do is keep putting lotion on them because that makes it so the ulcers aren't†so tough and so hard to manage. So making sure that you make time to put some kind of skin softener or some kind of lotion on your feet.</Content>

<Content id="0">Nausea, I usually get that the first couple days that I'm on the drug and then it kind of goes away, but it's never gone completely.† I carry my anti-nausea drug with me all the time, so if by some chance I have that feeling, I pop one of these and hopefully it passes. And for the most part it does. The medicine I use for the nausea works actually very, very well.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">As soon as you start to feel some of those ulcers that you let your doc know.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Essentially, you get these ulcers all through your mouth and it was so disgusting. I couldn't drink; I couldn't eat anything. It was all in my mouth and down my throat. That was probably the worst side effect I've ever experienced, was this mucositis. Right now I'm using this liquid because I have a couple ulcers now, but nothing like I had before. So I have this other rinse that I take a Q-tip and just kind of coat the inside of my mouth with it. It really makes it a lot more tolerable. But if you start to get, what I didn't realize that was mucositis. I mean I read about it, I'd looked at books all this other kind of thing, but nobody told me that this was going to really kill your mouth and you're not going to be able to eat, so this was an area where I could have used a little more education. I didn't have it. I would recommend that as soon as you start to feel some of those ulcers that you let your doc know. If they have a nurse navigator or some type of nurse let them know early because I didn't know what was happening and I didn't tell anyone up front because I just thought it was a mouth sore and that would be it. So what I did for it was I had this rinse I had this almost like Lidocaine gel sort of that I would put on the inside of my mouth to try and help them heal. I also got these laser treatments all inside my mouth on each sides of my tongue, all the way, she would go this far but then that was it and that helped a lot. Really, really helped a lot, but I wish I would have known about those things much earlier because I think I would have started some of that stuff way before my mouth got so disgustingly gross.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Even when I went to doctor's appointments I would write down who I saw, what, for instance the CAT scan was fine. They didn't see anything unusual. That's really been a big help.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">I would strongly recommend people keep a journal or if you want, a word document on your computer or you know something you can reference back because and actually this was helpful in starting to write my book. I went back to the very beginning when I started when I was Initially sick, and I have all this stuff written down so that if I forgot something I could go back and look and say, "No, no, no I didn't start that drug until Friday or something like that." Very helpful. Even when I would go to doctor's appointments I would write down who I saw, what, for instance the CAT scan was fine. They didn't see anything unusual. That's really been a big help. Other than I now have 5 of these little notebooks filled with stuff. But it's very helpful. Now some people don't go back to the old paper and pencil anymore, so there are tons of apps out there. If you just go in and search. Well, you can start out searching for cancer and there are all kind of different ones out there. Again, trial and error, what works for you. I don't want to make more work for myself, so I try to use the app. If it's real complicated, forget it I'm not using it, but for something that makes a lot of sense then I actually use the app and it's been extremely helpful. Very, very helpful.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">You never know when you first start an oral chemo how it's going to affect you.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Some of the side effects I've dealt with from oral chemo mostly have to do with my digestion and my stomach whether it's happy or unhappy. Keeping it happy has always been kind of trial and error. You get told that you're going to have upset stomach or you're going to have diarrhea or you're going to have constipation and so you try it and you see. And so one night you're running out in the middle the night to buy Imodium, and the next they are running out the middle the night to buy you know MiraLAX. You never know when you first start an oral chemo how it's going to affect you. I can read the box. I am a smart girl. So I know often what to expect, but I don't know what I'm going to expect. Because although those drugs are great for the masses, it doesn't always mean it's going to be great for me.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">There have been times when my hands and feet hurt so bad that I didn't know what to do, and I've tried everything.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Another thing is that hand and foot, I don't know if they call it hand and foot disease or I†forget what they call it, but it's been funny I use it as an excuse not to do dishes. I tell my husband that I can't. "No, I can't wear rubber gloves either. I have to just not do dishes." He's going to know now that I can do dishes, but there have been times when my hands and feet hurt so bad that I didn't know what to do, and I've tried everything. You know Cataphyll and udder cream and just take Vaseline a pair of socks on and that will be just fine. I've tried all of those and not all them work. Some of them I think are just advertisements from the people that make the products because I've never had any relief, but you find ways around them. For instance, my hands would get really bad, really sensitive. I was always wearing gloves. Well I found fingerless gloves. Because I would type and I used to tell everybody at my old work that I was cold and it was keeping me warm. No, it wasn't that, it was protecting my hands; it was keeping my hands from hurting even worse and keeping them covered so it didn't get worse that night. Because there were a lot of times I would go home, and my hands and feet would hurt so bad that I'd have a hard time sleeping. The hands were always more obvious than my feet, and the hands used to be worse than my feet too. So I was always trying to protect my hands not getting them to cold or not to hot or anything like that. My feet, if I knew I was going out into snow I probably wouldn't have done it, because the pain that would have been associated with that afterwards would not have been worth it. But a lot of it came down to Vaseline. It made my feet nice and soft and I would just put on a pair of socks over it, which in turn helped me stay warm which is always a problem when of course you don't have any hair. But the Vaseline was probably the best bet I did.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">It has affected my hands mostly, which has been pretty frustrating because stupid things like putting on eyeliner have become very difficult for me.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Neuropathy can be really frustrating. I didn't experience it until probably six months ago, so I made it four years with no neuropathy. Everybody is, "How's the neuropathy" and I'm going, "What neuropathy" and I've had some pretty serious chemos. And I don't know why it has only just affected me. But it has affected my hands mostly, which has been pretty frustrating because stupid things like putting on eyeliner have become very difficult for me. Because I know they are there and I know what movement they need to go through, but I can't tell they are going through that movement. Does that sound fair? So, I'll be trying to pick something up and I'll think I have it, but I can't feel necessarily that I have it. So, I'm starting to get some of my feeling back in my hands which has been huge because I used to braid my kids hair left and right, you know braids every day. "Mom can you do this new kind of crazy braid?" "Sure." But I can't feel the strands, but I know I'm doing it right. So sometimes you have to have a little faith that what you are doing because of muscle memory still works even if you can't feel it ,you have to know it is still working. Predominately it's numbness, but every once in a while I'll have needles almost like my hand fell asleep, but I know it didn't because it never goes away. So mostly I deal with numbness. Mostly in my right hand. Mostly in my fingers, but it also keeps my right hand closed so where as if you just sat down however naturally your hands would sit my right hand closes up.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">A good portion of the time I'll hear it from the doctor and I'll go talk to the nurses because sometimes they are more informed about side effects or this will do that or whatever interaction I might have than the doctors will.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A good portion of the time I'll hear it from the doctor and I'll go talk to the nurses because sometimes they are more informed about side effects or this will do that or whatever interaction I might have than the doctors will. I get more from the relationship with my nurse than from my doctor. I understand that. I can understand that reasoning. He's so busy. He's trying to save peoples' lives and it's not just mine. But I have fantastic PA's that I don't call them doctor so and so. I call them Mary Anne. I call them Peg. I call them by their first name. Maybe I'm a different patient, maybe I'm more vocal than some, but I've made relationships with these people because I've got to find a way through this. I can't go in there and call my oncologist by his first name. He'd think I was crazy, but I do call his wife by her first name. I do know her and I'm in a support group with her and I can call her by the first name, but I can't call him. Everybody else, from the person that checks me in to the person that walks me back, I know all their names and I know something about all of them. But it allows me probably to be more human than my time with my oncologist because they know the answers. And sometimes you know, they'll sneak answers to me or they'll know something's bothering me and tell me a way around it or a great article. Like, I do give them back and forth, a lot of the information I have, but they also give me what they have. And sometimes together it works. Not always, but I would say it is hugely important.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">The first time I lost it I was devastated. Let's just be honest. I was 33 I had only been married 8 years.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The first time I lost it I was devastated. Let's just be honest. I was 33 I had only been married 8 years. What is my husband going to think about it? What are my kids going to think about it? What is my work going to think about it? I can't afford a wig. There are just so many things that go through your head. So shaved my head and I covered my head with wigs and everything else the first time. I was very cognizant of how other people were going to view me. I honestly believe my husband loves me no matter what. For my daughters, I was losing my hair by the handful. I let them dye it. It was a little blue, it was a little pink, and it was a little purple. Because you know what it was going to fall out, so go ahead. It only lasted for about a day because I was losing it that fast. My husband taught them how to use clippers. He the first time used to shave my head all the time. I'd be like, "It's getting a little crazy over here can you fix that?" He'd be like, "bzzzzz," because he did his own. This time with my kids we let them all shave my head. I wore a wig for the first week. I wore it here, I wore it to work. I even wore it to Texas where it was super-duper hot for a site we did, and I was a big sweaty mess. You should have seen me trying to figure out how take the head through security. Because I did, because I had such a complex like I had to put it on the head and I had to brush it and I had to do the hair. I didn't even do my hair when I had hair. So after about a week I said forget this. I started to wear a head cover that actually somebody here recommended. And at the time I couldn't afford them. They were expensive and super cute and I told my mom about them well what did my mom do, but go buy a couple? So then I could actually, instead of wearing the same head cover that I'd been wearing for four and a half years, I'm not even kidding, I now had four new ones that I could wear. Well my hair grew in and I started to every once in a while to show people the new me, my new head. I've gotten, "Well you're lucky you've got a good shaped head," or, "You're lucky your hair is all coming in consistently," or any kind of possible things. Mostly positive nobody's ever said anything bad to me, but I've said to my kids, if you need me to I'll put my wig on. If you want me to pick you up at school with my wig on, if you want me to go to parent teacher conference with my wig on, I don't care just tell me. Let's be honest. Let's be open. Nope I like you like this. My five year old will fall asleep rubbing my head. I've caught my husband every once in awhile rubbing my head. It's like, we'll get you a dog because that's about what it feels like. I go everywhere bald. Except when I'm freezing then I'll wear a head wrap. I've given up and just said, "You know this is just what it is." Part of me wants to make it platinum, or red, or black, but then I think then it's going to grow in and I'm going to have to dye it again. I'm more bugged by my eyebrows and my eyelashes cause those ones you lose too. When you get a hair losing chemo you lose you eyebrows and eyelashes too. And without those to frame your face, I wear my glasses a lot more because I think it just gives me a frame. So the first time I had pin straight, like middle of my back hair, and I would grow it out every pregnancy and then donate it. I had done that 3 times and so I thought I was going to have this pin straight hair well no it came back in curly and it was super curly to the point where I would have these curls that would come right next to my head and I'd try to be pinning them back and id try to be pin the hair behind my ears. I was trying to figure all that out. But definitely I experienced a different consistency.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Understand what your rights are, and you do have rights and what your options are.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">So what I would encourage people to do is to do some research at home. Understand what your rights are, and you do have rights and what your options are. You can go to a situation where you can work part time or you can reduce your work schedule or you can go on a short-term disability or you can go under social security. I have always been able, since my metastatic diagnosis, I have been able to go on disability, but I would not be the person I am today if I went on disability. I have to come here, and I have to talk to people, I have to interact and do all those things, so that is not the right option for everybody. I would learn at home on my own, and then I would approach my HR department. I would choose my allies carefully in my cancer battle in my work, because some works are going to just rally behind you and they're going to make it worth it, but some aren't. And I don't think we really know which one they are going to end up being until they're in that position.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">When I got home and started seeing some of the side effects and I thought oh my goodness this is going to be bad, so what did I do? I called my oncologist.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">I was given this handy dandy little bag. You're all going to know which drug I was on, but this bag. And in it, it had Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. AM, PM. It had my little insert, and it had some things that could help me, dietitional stuff, and all kinds of stuff and they are like, "here you go" the drug will show up in a week. And your like, "I guess I'll go read it." So then you read it and you have no idea what half of it is. You read what you can and understand what you can, but so much of it is medical terminology that unless you're a nurse or doctor that you don't necessarily get. But that is all they give you, but I took the time and I sat and I read it, and I also didn't blindly just follow the directions. When I got home and started seeing some of the side effects and I thought. "Oh my goodness this is going to be bad, so what did I do?" I called my oncologist. Actually I texted or emailed him and he emails me back in the middle of the night and I said. "There has got to be an alternative to this drug it sounds awful, this is kind of scaring me. What else can I do instead of this drug?" It's probably the question that has gotten me through the last two and a half years. "That sounds terrible, what else can I do instead of that." He was like, "No, it looks scary, but it's not going to be scary. So you go home and try it." After the first week you're like, "I'm still ok." After the second week you're like, "I'm still okay." And the third week comes and you go, "Well my hand is kind of bothering me, but I'm still okay. Okay this is going to work. I'm going to take this one."</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">And that's what it comes down to. Is that if I can get this drug more reasonably then I'll take the drug maybe I'll live a little bit longer and my family isn't in debt yet. Yet.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Now I'm onto my third set of paperwork to get their approval to give me a drug that is out there. It's just whether or not my health care will cover it. And I've gone as far as having to give my tax returns for last year before they will agree to give me a drug discounted. Because sometimes you may get a drug and you may say, "I really have to have this drug and I'm going to spend 5,000 dollars a month on this drug." And that's okay. If that's what you have to do to get treatment and to be healthy, then that's what you do. But in my case I'm battling if I make too much money, if I don't make enough money like I'm kind of amazed by it. It's amazing what they'll ask you. Like I said, household income, what, why do you need my household income? But that is because they are asking, obviously I got approved on some level but at some very high rate so of course my doctor's office is trying to combat this really high rate and they're trying to prove that I need it and I need it at a discounted rate. So there's a lot going on right now. It's probably been about two and a half weeks and it still hasn't been approved. From the time my oncologist first told me about it he's, "Oh there's alternatives but they have these awful side effects. This drug works and we know it works and people have a decent quality of life on it." So I'm like, "I'm all in." I've done the research and I've read about it. I've found the same thing he did that the alternatives have negative side effects. But yeah right now the oncologist office is trying to get it for me so it's a little bit more reasonable. Right now the one that I have not been officially approved for will be 3,000 dollars and it will be 3 pills a day for 30 days. So, 90 pills 3,000 dollars. And I have good insurance, very good insurance. And I look and I say, "I have three little girls. One is about to be 10, ones about to be 8 and one is four. And would I rather die without them being in debt or take this drug?" And that's what it comes down to. Is that if I can get this drug more reasonably then I'll take the drug, maybe I'll live a little bit longer, and my family isn't in debt yet. Yet. Because some of the drugs get very expensive and that is why we're are still battling. It's funny, you know I talk to the people here at the office and they're like, "Who can we call?" Well that is a very good question. I don't know. Is there somebody you can call? Is there somebody anyone of us average Joes can call not through health care? Do they care? Are they going to take our call? I don't know that answer.</Content>

<Content id="0">I think because my sister works in a pharmacy that I'm really kind of crazy about the oral adherence kind of stuff. Also, because I believe in chemo and I don't think I'm going to heal miraculously. It's very hard to take oral chemo because you know you are going to get sick. It's hard to have those pills in your hand and know you don't want to take them. You don't want the side effects that are coming out of those little pills. The reality is your body needs it and you've got to take them. There are a lot of people I know that don't, and there are a lot of people that don't follow schedules. There are a lot of people that miss a dose. I wouldn't. I would take it with me. I'm pretty conscientious about that stuff.</Content>

<Content id="0">If you find you are going to be on drug ABC, you can get the information from your doctor, your nurses all those things. You can go online, but most of the time they have a board like that you can go on and read other people that are dealing with ABC drug and what side effects they are dealing with. I was telling my friend, my tongue always hangs to the left, and that's a joke. It really doesn't. But how did you know that could be a side effect, that your tongue could hang to the left? It's this crazy thing. Well, because I read it on a board and it didn't just happen to one person. I actually had that with a bone drug that I had. It was giving me the worst side effect which was just my mental well-being was not good. And I thought I was going crazy because I was feeling crazy. But I couldn't prove that I was doing this and I went on some of the boards and there it was and multiple times. That this drug causes this effect for people but it wasn't in any of the printed material and it wasn't anything my doctor or nurses had dealt with, but it was something that was on the boards that came related to that drug.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">There are some days, I'm not going to make it, I'm going to take one of these pills and I'm going to just zone out for a little bit. That's okay because everybody needs a mental break.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Cancer is not easy to deal with because you didn't ask for it. Were you at home licking asbestos? Probably not. Was this a surprise? Did this come out of the blue? Absolutely. But sometimes you got to figure out other ways to get around it. I know a lot of people use yoga and all this stuff, not for me. I'd rather spend the time with my kids. But what I do is I imagine a box and I put my cancer in that box, and I wrap that box up and I put the box up on a shelf. And I bring it down when I need to talk about it, when I'm upset about it, when something changes and I deal with it and I cry and I'm mad and I'm sometimes mean because I didn't deserve this. I didn't ask for this. But then I promptly put the lid back on and I wrap it back up and I put it back on that shelf and I go back to being a mom. I go back to being a wife. I go back to being an employee. I go back to those things that help me not think about cancer. And I've been pretty fortunate that I don't have to take a lot of stuff. I know there are a lot of people that do and I totally understand that. There are some days where I am like, "I'm not going to make it and I'm going to take one of these pills and I'm going to just zone out for a little bit." And that's okay because everybody needs a mental break. I don't care if you have cancer or not. I've got three kids and cancer and there are sometimes that I think about it. I'll just take one every day, but it is not the right choice, and I have found that the box works for me.</Content>

<Content id="0">So I had some left over and I thought, "Just take it back to chemo. Hi, I have this. What do I do with this?" "Oh, we don't take it." "Well, what do I do with this?" "Well, you take it back to a pharmacy." "Okay great." So I went back to my pharmacy and I said, "Hi, I need to return this." "We can't take that and they handed me an envelope and they said you take this envelope and you mail it back." I said, "Great, I'll look at this. Wait, you are going to charge me shipping?" I had to pay shipping to send it back. But I ended up going through my neighborhood grocery store that gave me a thing that I had to pay to ship back and I stuck it in there and shipped it back. And I've heard you can sometimes take them to like a firehouse, police station and stuff like that. I've never had to do that, but I've seen places that you could do that and then you don't have to at least pay the shipping and I'm sure it's a lot more convenient. You can't really flush them down the toilet because what it is doing to you it's going to do the plants and animals that it eventually is going to run into. It's going to make our water treatment facilities work even harder to kind of manage and get back to a normal levels, so no you can't really go throw all your chemo in your toilet. It is just not preferred.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">It's going to remind you that, yeah cancer is there, but you're not dead.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Just holding my husband's hand can be enough. Like, sometimes you're doing chemo and you're fighting, you're just fighting at every turn. You're going to fight to go to work. You're going to fight to go to your kid's baseball game. You're going to fight to feel well enough to go to that movie with your girlfriend. And it is a constant battle. And there are sometimes that you just need that emotional, physical reminder that there is somebody there in your corner. I'm very lucky. I have a fantastic husband. I don't know what I did without him because he's a great dad, he's a great husband, and he's a great person. Before I got married my mother said, "You know your husband is going to want to have sex and you're not, but you're going to have sex because that's what your husband wants. But there's going to be, as many times you want to have sex where your husband doesn't, but he's going to have sex because it's what you want. There are going to be times when you don't want to and you're going to because it's going to be the right thing in your marriage, in your home behind your closed doors with your husband. It's the right thing to do for the two of you and there are going to be times you don't want to do it, but you're going to figure it out." And she says, my mom, my mom's a handful, and she'll be like, "I guarantee two minutes later you're going to like it. You're going to have fun. Because it's going to remind you that, yeah cancer is there, but you're not dead." Like, I have a terrible, awful cancer and it's pulling me apart piece by piece, but I'm not dead.</Content>
