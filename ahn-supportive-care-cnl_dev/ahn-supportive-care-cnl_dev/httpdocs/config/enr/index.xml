<Content id="0">Welcome to the Enersource Long Term Plan Dialogue website. I'm Gia DeJulio. This site will allow you to give us some feedback on our Long Term Plan while also answering some of the questions that you may have. We know that your time is valuable, so this site lets you choose to hear about topics that are most of interest to you. If you like, you can start with a brief overview of how electricity gets to you. This provides some important background to understand our Long Term Plan. Or you can go directly to our introduction of the Long Term Plan. At any point, you can learn more about various topics by following the links along the right hand side. To be eligible for the draw for a Samsung Galaxy Tablet, Enersource customers will need to listen to a brief description of our Long Term Plan and then provide feedback on 11 core questions. These core questions are indicated by a question mark next to them. You can track your progress along the left hand side where the completed questions are shown with a checkmark. There are other places where you can provide feedback along the way, but these questions are optional. Overall, our discussion should take about 20 minutes, depending on how much information you want to know.  Along the way, you'll be able to explore other topics and ask questions of your own.  If you don't have time to finish the discussion today, you can come back when you have some more time and we'll pick up where you left off.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Introduction to Shared Priorities</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">As a customer, you need safe, reliable, affordable electricity.  And we need to make sure our electricity delivery system keeps up with demand in Mississauga. To do this, we are constantly evaluating the system and planning for the future. Recently we reached out to some of our customers and asked them to share their thoughts on the electricity system. They told us that they want reliable and affordable electricity that is environmentally friendly. We share these priorities.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Reliability</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The four priorities are all interrelated.  We'll start by focusing on reliability. For us, reliability means minimizing outages and minimizing voltage fluctuations, which are variations in power. To do this, there are three major challenges that we have to continue to address in our Plan. The first challenge is aging equipment. The second is increased demand for electricity from growth and the new ways people require power. The third challenge is damage to the system caused by people and natural events like weather. I'll review each of these challenges briefly then talk about the elements of the Long Term Plan.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Reliability 002</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Let's start with aging equipment. Many of our substations and distribution lines were installed over 40 years ago as part of significant development that got underway in the late 1970s and 80s. Our territory covers over 288 square kilometers and includes about 5200 kilometers of lines, 20,000 wood or concrete poles, and 25,000 transformers. People often think weather is the primary cause of power disruptions, which tends to be true for the big outages like the ice storm of 2013. Most outages -- like the ones that affect a small number of people for a short period of time -- are typically caused by aging equipment. It is important that we maintain the system and keep it up to date so we can continue to reliably deliver power to our growing customer base.</Content>

<Content id="0">The second challenge is the demand for electricity due to growth since 1974 when Mississauga became a city, and the City's plans for future growth. Current growth in electricity demand is from construction of new townhouses, condominium high-rises, and business offices, along with the many new and changing ways we use electricity. Think of the number of electronic devices you use at home or at work:  computers, cell phones, televisions, gaming systems to name just a few.  In the next decade, we need to prepare for the increased demand for electricity from transportation, from electric cars, and from the electrification of the GO Train system.

To meet this changing and growing demand, we need to maintain and replace the original equipment.</Content>

<Content id="0">The third challenge is preparing for and responding to damage to the system caused by people and natural events like weather. Most people don't know that public vehicles colliding with and damaging our equipment are a more frequent source of outages than weather events! We have one of the lowest rates of outages in Canada, but still, service interruptions do occur. Our team is always prepared for outages. When there is a power disruption, our goal is to get our customers back online as soon as possible. We make sure our people are well trained; that our fleet of vehicles is well maintained; and that we have the equipment and technology needed to spot potential issues so we can prevent outages, and react as quickly as possible when they do occur.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What causes my lights to dim or flicker?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Sometimes customers ask us about flickering or dimming lights or brief interruptions to their power supply.  These may be caused by an imbalance of the voltage level or the amount of electricity that is supplied to your home or business. Voltage fluctuations can be caused by issues inside your home or business, such as appliances or other electrical equipment that briefly draws a higher amount of power. Or voltage fluctuations can be caused by problems outside your home or business in a situation where the Provincial power grid may have slightly more demand than can be supplied by the generation. This is called brown outs. If this persists, you may eventually have the power of the system fail, and this is known as a black out. In addition, power surges or spikes are commonly caused by lightning strikes on the local distribution system or the Provincial power grid.</Content>

<Content id="0">A lot of people believe that using renewable energy will decrease costs. Renewable energy has a great benefit to the environment. Currently 33% of Ontario's energy is provided by renewables. Hydroelectric power accounts for 24%, 8% is from wind, 1% is from biomass, and the balance is from solar. The Ontario Government's Long Term Energy Plan forecasts by 2025, 20,000 MW or approximately 50% of Ontario's installed capacity will be from renewable sources. While costs for renewable electricity from wind and solar are coming down, wind and solar renewable electricity is still more expensive than traditional sources of nuclear and natural gas.</Content>

<Content id="0">One of the best ways to reduce your electricity cost is to use less power. You can reduce how much power you use through a variety of conservation programs offered by Enersource and the Independent Electricity System Operator. You can also manage your usage by adjusting when you perform energy-intensive activities, like using the dishwasher or doing the laundry.  By doing these activities during off peak hours, which are 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. Monday to Friday and all day on Weekends and Holidays, you will be using electricity at the lowest cost pricing period. If you want to track your daily usage, you can monitor your bill online through the Enersource website. If you want to learn more about reducing your electricity usage, I invite you to visit our website -- <![CDATA[<a href="http://www.enersource.com" target="_blank">http://www.enersource.com</a>]]></Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why does electricity cost so much?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">You might be wondering why there are so many lines on your bill. The simple answer is that the Ontario Energy Board requires us to follow a specific billing format. It is intended to provide enough information for customers across Ontario to make informed choices on how much electricity they use and when they wish to use it. Your electricity charges reflect the cost of electricity purchased by Enersource on your behalf that you use in your home or business. Enersource does not charge a mark-up on this cost. We pay the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) for their electricity. Then they pay the generators of electricity, including Ontario Power Generation, which is owned by the province of Ontario. You will be billed based on when and how much electricity you use. Time of use rates are calculated as displayed in the chart on the screen. Red represents the on-peak period, which is also the most expensive time. Yellow depicts the mid-peak or moderate cost period. Green represents the off-peak or least expensive time period. Time of use rates change each year in May and November and are set by the Ontario Energy Board, not Enersource. The Delivery Charge reflects the cost of delivering electricity from the generator to Enersource and then to your home. It is a combination of transmission charges and local distribution charges. The transmission charge includes costs associated with building and maintaining transmission power and lines as part of the distribution grid. The other portion of the delivery charge is from Enersource's local distribution system, which brings the power from the grid to your home or business. Costs collected for transmission and operation of the provincial grid are paid directly to the IESO, who then passes on the payments to transmission companies including Hydro One, which is owned by the Province of Ontario. Enersource does not charge a markup on this transmission cost. Enersource's charges for delivery to your home or business are approved by the Ontario Energy Board, which reviews our costs to build and maintain our local distribution system. This is approximately 20% of your total bill. The regulatory charge reflects the cost of administering the wholesale electricity system, including the settlement of payments I described earlier, and maintaining the reliability of the provincial grid. These charges are collected without mark-up by Enersource and passed on to the IESO.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Long Term Plan 003</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are three parts to our Long Term Plan: First, System Service and System Access which covers converting higher voltage electricity from the grid to the lower voltage electricity that you use. It also covers connecting new customers, and things like moving sections of our system to make way for expanded roads or the new Light Rail Transit system. System Service and System Access costs are expected to increase about 30% in total over the next 5 years, compared to spending in these areas over the previous five years. Next, System Renewal, which covers repairing and maintenance of our current distribution system. We expect our costs here to increase about 20% over the next 5 years. And finally, what we call General Plant, which covers things like our buildings, trucks, employee costs, training, computer equipment and other operating costs. This will use about 15% of our capital budget. We haven't planned any large, new investments in this area in the next five years, so there is no increase in this part. My colleagues will explain each of these parts in more detail.  After each section, we'll invite you to comment, answer any questions you have, and ask a couple of questions we have for you.</Content>

<Content id="0">The System Service and System Access plan covers improvements and upgrades to our distribution system that will assure the delivery of electricity safety and reliability. To prepare for increased demand in Mississauga, our Plan covers the need to expand our system of substations, lines, and other equipment to connect new homes, especially condo developments, and businesses. And we need to tie in small renewable energy sources such as wind turbines and rooftop solar powered systems. These investments are among the most basic of the activities that we do, as they are required to assure that we deliver electricity safely and reliably as we move forward.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0"> Is electricity generated here exported to other Provinces or the US?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">If Ontario generates more than it needs, electricity generated here is exported to other provinces and sometimes to the US.  And if Ontario's demand is very high, the province sometimes imports electricity from other provinces and from the US North East. The IESO -- Independent Electricity System Operator -- manages the output of all of the generating power plants in Ontario and the importing and exporting electricity, as well as the tie in of renewables.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the significant changes in the electricity industry in recent years?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Ten years ago, the Ontario government introduced the Green Energy Act. In a nutshell, the Act helped introduce renewable electricity generation and conservation initiatives to the public. This new Act really changed the electricity industry for the local distribution companies and for customers as well. In addition to focusing on the economic and efficient delivery of electricity, the industry also had to focus on the promotion of renewable generation, conservation, and establishing the smart grid. The smart grid enables two way communication between an LDC, like Enersource, and its customers through the use of various technologies. Similar to how a smart phone means a phone with a computer in it, smart grid means computerizing the electricity grid. It includes adding two way digital communication technology to devices associated with the grid such as meters, transformers, and substations.</Content>

<Content id="0">The smart grid basically enables two way communication between customers and the electricity system network -- called the grid.  In order to facilitate that two way communication, smart meters were introduced in Ontario starting in 2005.  A smart meter measures how much and when a customer uses electricity. Customers are able to track their consumption in real time to help them manage their own electricity usage. Customers can control or conserve their electricity consumption by using electricity when the rates are at their lowest cost, such as in the evening, and on weekends and holidays.</Content>

<Content id="0">According to Ministry of Energy between 2005 and 2013, conservation programs resulted in savings of about 8.7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity compared to what would have been consumed without conservation efforts. This conservation has resulted from various programs and through changes to codes and standards in the province. It is interesting to know that 8.7 billion kilowatt hours is enough electricity to power a city the size of Mississauga for a year.</Content>

<Content id="0">The Ontario Energy Board is an agency of the government. It is the independent regulator of the electricity industry. The OEB's role is to make sure that electricity is produced and distributed in a way that is reliable, economically efficient, and cost effective. The OEB is charged with maintaining the balance between LDCs, operating as economically sound companies, and consumers, ensuring that the costs they pay for electricity are reasonable.</Content>

<Content id="0">In the past the OEB was primarily focused on the cost effectiveness of companies like ours. They regulated the revenue of local distribution companies that led to the rates customers paid for electricity. That's not sufficient anymore. Now in addition to regulating rates, the OEB wants us to demonstrate successful customer outcomes. They ask us: What are the benefits to customers of the initiatives you have undertaken? So now LDCs like Enersource are required to have very detailed 5 year plans that describe the various types of investment we plan to undertake to ensure reliability and affordability of electricity, along with how we have engaged our customers in the development of our plans. The OEB will then determine if our costs and resulting rates are prudent and justified.</Content>

For us this is like a high school student's report card!  The Scorecard reports on things such as the number of times that customer power is interrupted and for how long. A few other metrics the Scorecard also shows includes how long it takes to connect new customers or our timelines for responding to calls and the total costs per customer. It also reports on conservation initiatives, including peak demand savings and energy savings. Reporting publically and trying to improve on these metrics helps us to ensure our customers continue to receive value from the services we provide. To access our latest Scorecard, please visit the Enersource website and seach for Scorecard. Or go to the link shown on the screen.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0"> Who makes decisions about generation and the integration of renewable energy into the system?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The Independent Electricity System Operator - or IESO - is responsible for purchasing the overall supply of electricity that is provided to LDCs based on priorities set by the Ontario Government. The IESO ensures the desired mix of traditional and renewable generation is purchased - for example, electricity generated from nuclear, hydroelectric, and natural gas vs. generated from wind, solar, and biofuels. They are also responsible for dispatching generation making sure power is available to each part of the system when it is needed. Last year the electricity generated in the province was roughly 62% from nuclear power plants, about 24% from hydroelectric generation, and about 10% from natural gas plants. The rest was from wind power (about 4%) and small amounts of solar and biofuels. Over the next few years, we expect to see those renewable sources increasing. The IESO plays a critical role in our electricity system. They are responsible for the real time balance of electricity supply and demand in Ontario, in every part of the system, at every moment throughout the day!</Content>

<Content id="0">Ontario has a lot more LDCs than other comparable places.  It has about 70 in fact!  This suggests that the industry can be more efficient with fewer organizations responsible for a larger electricity distribution system and a greater number of customers.  This prompted the government to ask the industry to consider voluntary consolidation.  Many LDCs including Enersource are looking at where it makes sense to merge with other utilities.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0"> Why is aging infrastructure such a big issue for LDCs?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">After the Second World War, there was a huge construction boom across North America. So much of our large infrastructure - including highways, sewage and water treatment systems, and electricity grids - were built during that post-war period. This boom continued - especially in places like Mississauga - through the 1990s, where development of housing subdivisions and commercial centers continued to grow. Now most of that infrastructure, not only the electricity system but also the roads and sewer systems, are reaching their expected end of life and need to be replaced. During the rapid growth of Mississauga, much of the expansion of the electricity system was paid for by developers, who passed along the cost as part of the price of the houses they built. Today as LDCs like us replace infrastructure, these changes are primarily to support continued electricity delivery to existing homes and businesses. So, these costs have to be passed on to our electicity users and can't be offset by charges to developers. When replacing equipment, we focus on more efficient and effective solutions like the Smart Grid, which supports two-way communication to enable customers to better manage their electricity use and costs. We are building a much better system for the next 40 and possible even 50 years.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is happening with the Merger?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">In April 2015, four local electricity distribution companies or LDCs announced a plan to develop the second largest electricity utility in the province.  Since then, Enersource, Horizon, Hydro One Brampton and PowerStream have been working together to create a new entity that will serve nearly one million customers in Mississauga, Barrie, Hamilton, Markham, St. Catharines and Vaughan. Collectively, each utility involved is committed to the delivery of electricity at reasonable distribution rates, as well as the provision of efficient and innovative technologies for customers. We believe the proposed merger will be beneficial for all customers, the communities involved and each of our shareholders.</Content>

<Content id="0">Despite our strong performance in the past, we recognize that the industry is changing.  Through the proposed partnership, we expect to take advantage of opportunities to be more efficient as a combined utility. These efficiencies would likely result in customer distribution rates that are lower than they otherwise would have been had we not combined utilities, while still ensuring profitability for our shareholders.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the energy grid?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Ontario's electricity system is made up of three parts: first, the creation or generation of the electricity, then sending the electricity to your local power distribution company, or LDC, and finally, converting it into useable energy and delivering it to your home or business.  These steps are known as generation, high-voltage transmission and distribution.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How is our electricity generated?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">About 24% of our electricity in Ontario is made from renewable hydro power. Approximately 37% of our electricity is made from nuclear power. Nuclear power is a clean, efficient way of making electricity. Other power plants use natural gas to make about 29%   of the province's electricity. And as technology continues to improve, more wind, solar and other renewable resources are being used to make electricity.  Combined, this makes up the remainder of Ontario's supply.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">So how does electricity get to my home?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">First the electricity travels at high voltage from the power plants, wind turbines or solar panels across high-voltage transmission lines, to substations.  Substations lower the voltage so that electricity can be sent safely across distribution lines for use in your home or business. Local Distribution Companies like Enersource deliver power through these lower voltage lines to customers like you.</Content>
