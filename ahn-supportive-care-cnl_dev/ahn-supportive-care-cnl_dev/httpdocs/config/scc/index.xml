<Content id="0">If the healthcare team has determined that there is a possibility for a life-saving transplant, a referral to a Transplant Coordinator will be made.  The Transplant Coordinator will review the patient's medical records and determine if they meet the requirements for a transplant.  Eligibility for organ transplants is determined by each transplant center.  A patient's overall health is considered, along with the impact that the transplant is likely to have on the patient's ability to resume daily activities.</Content>

<Content id="0">Your heart is a muscle that pumps blood throughout your body, keeping all of your cells working by giving them the oxygen and fuel they need, and taking away the waste that they produce.  Heart failure means that the heart is not pumping blood throughout the body as well as it needs to.  Doctors describe heart failure in stages, and the most serious of these is End stage heart failure.  In End stage heart failure, other parts of the body do not get the oxygen and fuel they need to survive.  Also, fluids that are normally carried away by the blood start to build up, making it hard to breathe and causing swelling of the limbs and sometimes the lungs, which is called pulmonary edema.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is kidney failure?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Your kidneys clean your blood.  They remove waste and help balance water, salt and other minerals, called electrolytes, in the blood. When your kidneys stop working, these waste products, excess fluids, and electrolytes build up in your body.  Kidney failure is described in stages and the most serious of these is called end stage kidney failure. When a person has end stage kidney failure, the waste products build up to levels that are toxic, or harmful to the brain and other organs. People cannot live without having their blood cleaned.  If a person's kidneys are not cleaning their blood, they need to use a machine, called a dialysis machine, to filter toxins out of the blood.</Content>

<Content id="0">Uremia is a condition caused by the waste building up in the blood due to kidney failure, and, if left untreated it may be fatal within a few days to a few weeks.   Usually people with kidney failure who are not on dialysis experience the following symptoms:  Loss of appetite and edema, or swelling of the legs, arms and chest from excess fluids, sleeping most of the day, restlessness, visions of people who are not present, disorientation, confusion and failure to recognize people they know, changes in breathing, an excess of fluid in the throat, a greyish color to the skin and changes in temperature.  As the toxins build up, a person will lose consciousness and the heart will stop beating.  At times it may sound as though someone whose kidneys are failing is struggling to breath or moaning, but with comfort measures to address any pain or discomfort, dying of kidney failure is generally very peaceful.</Content>

<Content id="0">The liver filters blood coming from the intestines and removes chemicals and drugs from the blood. It also makes the bile that the intestines use to break down fats, and makes proteins used in blood clotting and other functions. If the liver is damaged and cannot work properly, the symptoms may be confusion, changes in sleep patterns and tiredness.  There can be internal bleeding and fluid build-up that makes the patient look swollen or bloated, although there is usually loss of muscle and weight loss at the same time because nutrition is not being absorbed through the blood.  Constipation can also be a problem.</Content>

<Content id="0">Respiratory failure means that your blood is not getting enough oxygen to keep your other organs working or that your lungs are not able to remove enough carbon dioxide from the blood.  A person in respiratory failure may experience shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and feeling like they can't breathe in enough air. Skin, lips and fingernails can look bluish and the person may become very sleepy or confused. Respiratory failure can be very frightening; oxygen, medicines and comfort measures, which can be as simple as placing a fan near a person, will calm the patient.</Content>

<Content id="0">Intubation is a medical procedure that uses a tube and a machine called a ventilator to help get air into and out of your lungs.   If a person needs to be on a ventilator for more than a week, a tracheotomy is done to create a small opening in the throat for the breathing tube.  Patients who are intubated and on ventilators are not able to speak and may have to be fed through an intravenous, or IV line, or through a feeding tube.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What does it mean when a patient is actively dying?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">When a person is actively dying it means that they are showing signs that their body's systems are shutting down.  During the first phase, which normally starts months before death, the person may begin to spend less time with others, sleep more, and eat and drink less. This is not at all predictable, and each person will have a different experience.   Some patients may have one or several short periods of time where they appear to 'rally' and eat and drink a bit more, and appear more energetic and social.  Families can often believe that the patient is improving, only to see the patient return to declining health.

Usually within weeks of death, the person who is dying will become very tired, even difficult to wake.  Their breathing and heart rate may change and they may have fluid build up which makes breathing sound difficult.  They may experience increased pain.  Their body temperature may rise and fall throughout the day.  They will eat and drink less and will not urinate or move their bowels as much.

During the days or hours before death the patient may slip in and out of consciousness.  Their pulse may be unsteady and weak.  Body temperature drops and the skin around the knees, feet and hands looks purplish.  This is called mottling.  When this happens the person is usually very close to death.  Breathing is increasingly hard and may start and stop for a time before their last breath is drawn.</Content>

<Content id="0">Brain death happens when the brain is damaged to the point where it can no longer support breathing and this damage cannot be repaired.  There are three conditions that must be met for a diagnosis of brain death:  The first condition is that the patient is in a coma, second, that the patient has no brainstem reflexes such as blinking, coughing or gagging,  and third, that the patient is not able to breathe on their own.</Content>

<Content id="0">Terminal weaning means removing ventilator support from a dying patient.   A person who cannot breathe on their own because of respiratory failure may be placed on a machine called a ventilator to breath for them.  Terminal weaning refers to stopping ventilator or breathing support when it is expected that the person will die from respiratory failure once the ventilator is removed. Usually medications are given to ease any discomfort that may be experienced after the ventilator is removed.  This may also be referred to as removing life support.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a vegetative state?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Patients with severe brain damage may enter a vegetative state, or loss of consciousness.  This means that they may show some signs of awareness but cannot truly respond to things around them.  People in a vegetative state may show some signs of awareness, such as opening their eyes and swallowing in response to being fed.   Their eyes may move and they may appear to be sleeping and waking.  They may also grind their teeth, smile, shed tears, grunt, moan, or scream for no apparent reason.

However, these actions are reflex actions, meaning that they are done automatically by the body without thought. There is no sign that the patient is aware of the environment, or their own body, or that they can communicate with others, or act voluntarily.

After being in a vegetative state for an extended period, the patient is said to be in a persistent vegetative state or PVS.  If the vegetative state was caused by physical trauma, it may be considered a permanent vegetative state after one year.  If the vegetative state was not caused by traumatic injury, it may be considered a permanent vegetative state after 3 months.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a prognosis?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Prognosis is what doctors believe is going to happen over the course of an illness.  This includes how long someone is likely to live, and how the illness will affect a persons' health. Generally, life-limiting illnesses follow one of three paths, and knowing what to expect can help people who are dying, and their loved ones, to plan and make care decisions.

For someone with an illness like cancer there is usually a path of gradual decline over weeks, months or years until the person's last few months.  At this stage people become visibly sicker, begin to lose weight and may need help with everyday tasks and self-care.

Illnesses such as heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, follow a path of long term sickness that limits everyday activities and will also sometimes causes serious health problems that can require hospitalization.   People may survive many of these health problems, and recover some of their former level of activity, but over time their health and activity will continue to decline until they can no longer recover from these health problems.

People who have lived to an advanced age who do not have a life-limiting illness such as cancer or COPD follow a path of gradual physical and mental decline until their organ systems, the heart, lungs, liver or kidneys, can no longer recover from even minor physical injury or illness such as an infection or broken bone.</Content>

<Content id="0">Some things to consider about full medical care are that some treatments and tests can greatly decrease quality of life by causing side effects that can be worse than the symptoms they are designed to treat.  When receiving full medical care, patients are monitored continuously, so they may be attached to machines that take their pulse, breathing rate and other indicators of health.  Full medical care is usually provided in hospitals, which sometimes have limited visiting hours, little privacy, and may have regulations about bringing in pets, young visitors, and personal possessions.   Check with your healthcare team to determine what their regulations are and how flexible they can be to accommodate your wishes.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How are symptoms addressed if I have full medical care?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">With full medical care, common symptoms and side effects are treated with standard medical procedures.  For pain this may include limited use of powerful painkillers.  Some studies have shown that some patients do not receive enough pain medication to make them comfortable, even though there is little chance of addiction.   Shortness of breath is typically treated with oxygen or possibly intubation and ventilation using a machine.  Treatment for other conditions such as diabetes, also known as high blood sugar; and hypertension or high blood pressure, will continue under full medical care.  If a patient's heart stops when they're in the hospital, healthcare providers will perform advanced life saving measures to restore the heartbeat, unless the patient has a Do not Resuscitate order, or DNR.   These life saving measures may include chest compressions, defibrillation, and intubation. Medications such as vasopressors or anti-arrhythmics may also be used to restart the heart.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is Supportive Care?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Supportive care, also called palliative care, differs from full medical care in that rather than focusing on restoring the patient to their former health, Supportive Care is treatment given to improve the quality of life of patients who have a life-limiting illness. Supportive care may be used at any time to address symptoms of a disease or the side effects of treatment, as well as the medical, emotional, spiritual and social needs of the person who is dying and their loved ones.

Medically, supportive care focuses on symptom care, such as pain management, managing shortness of breath, and treating any condition that reduces comfort or quality of life. It can be provided along with treatments to extend life or can be employed when life extending treatment has stopped. Supportive care can be provided in any setting -- hospital, skilled nursing facility, in hospice or at home. Supportive Care is suggested for people who are likely to die within the next 12 months.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is hospice care?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Hospice care differs from full medical care and supportive care in that it is focused on the quality of life and comfort of patients who are likely to die within the next 6 months. It is usually provided at home or in a hospice facility. Patients choose hospice care when there is little hope of stopping or curing the disease and the patient does not want aggressive treatments. In hospice care, the focus is on comfort care, healthcare measures that ease pain and suffering. Patients suffering from other chronic conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes will still be treated for those conditions if it helps to make them more comfortable.

There are four levels of hospice care: 1) the most common hospice care delivery is routine home care where healthcare providers visit the patient at home 2) hospice care may also take place in a continuous home nursing care facility if the patient has healthcare problems that need special care 3) patients may receive inpatient respite care which is short term care and intended to relieve those caring for the patient and 4) general inpatient care which is short term and intended for pain control or symptom management which cannot be provided in other settings. Medicare usually covers 100 percent of the cost of hospice care, so patients and families pay little out of pocket costs. For details on what is covered under Medicare's hospice benefit, look in the Resources section.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the benefits of hospice care?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The goal of hospice care is to provide comfort during the final phases of a person's life so the time that they and their loved ones have remaining can be spent seeing to emotional and spiritual needs.

In hospice care, unnecessary medical equipment such as blood pressure cuffs and heart monitors, may be removed from the room to provide a more peaceful environment.  Because full medical care is discontinued, invasive tests and treatments such as antibiotics for infections and needle sticks for blood sugar testing and blood tests may no longer be needed.  Depending on the wishes of the patient or their loved ones, and the patient's condition, gastric tubes, catheters, and IV lines may also be removed.

Special attention is given instead to those treatments that provide comfort.  These treatments can include:

Pain management
Frequent repositioning to prevent bedsores
Providing desired food and fluids that can be consumed
Preventing constipation
Mouth care to prevent dry or chapped lips
And eye care to prevent discomfort from dry eyes.

If they are in a hospice or other medical facility, people receiving hospice care are often allowed more flexible visitation hours and more privacy, so that family and friends can be with them during their remaining time.  Specialized hospice facilities often have very open policies about visitation and items brought from home for the comfort of the person who is dying.  Hospice care can also be provided at home where loved ones can come and go and the patient can rest in a more peaceful and familiar environment.</Content>

<Content id="0">Supportive care can begin anytime a person is diagnosed with an illness that is life-limiting.  Supportive care is there to help manage serious illnesses like cancer or COPD when they are first diagnosed, long before they become life threatening.  In the early stages of an illness, supportive care can help with symptom management and quality of life at the same time that a person is receiving life-extending treatments.  Hospice care is intended to care for patients whose life expectancy is expected to be less than 6 months.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the difference between Hospice and Supportive Care?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Supportive care is there to support patients and their families from the first day they are diagnosed with an illness that could be life-limiting.  Some patients live years, even decades with such illnesses, but, throughout their life, they may need support to understand treatment choices, manage their symptoms, control pain and deal with their emotional, social and spiritual needs.  Patients in supportive care can continue to receive medical treatment that is meant to extend life or even cure the illness.  Hospice care, however, is only delivered when it is believed that a patient has less than 6 months to live and the patient and their family or caregivers have decided to discontinue aggressive medical treatment.  Hospice care focuses on keeping the patient comfortable and meeting the social and spiritual and emotional needs of both the patient and their loved ones.</Content>

<Content id="0">It is normal for your loved one to make sounds as though they are having difficulty breathing.  This may sound like a rumbling in the chest.  Gently moving them so that their head is elevated, or positioning the head so that fluids can drain naturally can help.   This is a normal part of the dying process, and if it has been decided that no assistance with breathing is desired, there is no need to contact emergency services.  You may contact your hospice provider if your loved one seems especially uncomfortable or distressed, or if you have any questions.</Content>

<Content id="0">The person who is dying may be unable to move themselves and may suffer from fragile skin. You can help with gentle repositioning at least every two hours to prevent bedsores.  If your loved one does not have control of their bladder or bowels, you will need to pay special attention to the skin around their buttocks and genitals.  Using diapers keeps urine and feces in contact with the skin and can cause the skin to break down.  The skin of elderly people is especially fragile and can tear if not treated with care.  Mild, soap free cleansers and soft wash cloths should be used to gently clean the area from front to back.  After cleansing, the area should be gently patted dry.  Your healthcare provider can give you more specific instructions about caring for your loved one. There are links to information on skin care and perineal care in the resources section.</Content>

<Content id="0">Towards the end-of-life, people usually drink less liquids as their kidneys start to shut down.  Because they are taking in less fluids, dry mouth, lips and dry eyes can cause them discomfort.   You can keep their lips from chapping by applying a lip balm and use eye drops to prevent dry eyes. A mouth swab or a few drops of water from a straw can help moisten their mouth.</Content>

<Content id="0">If your loved one has an appetite, your hospice caregiver or healthcare provider can help you determine if and what your loved one is able to eat and drink.  However, many times during the last stages of life, a person's appetite and need for fluids decreases.  This is the natural result of the organ systems shutting down.  In this case, the person is not starving.  Their body no longer needs food and fluids and the thought of eating or drinking can actually cause nausea.</Content>

<Content id="0">Effective pain management is key to maintaining comfort at the end-of-life.  Pain can usually be managed safely and effectively using pain medications.  Sometimes several medications are used in combination, and pain relievers can be used along with other palliative treatments as well.  There are some common misunderstandings about pain management and medications; for instance, some people worry about addiction or tolerance when powerful pain killers like morphine are used.  However, when used to control pain, medications like morphine rarely lead to the person needing increasing amounts of the medication; and, when these medications are properly prescribed, addiction is not a concern.  In fact, under-controlled pain leads to increased severity of pain.  Because of this, pain medications should be taken on schedule to keep pain under control.</Content>

<Content id="0">During the final days and weeks of life a person will grow weaker and weaker. They may sleep much of the time.  There may be times when they are alert and engage in conversation and other times when they seem confused.  They may 'see' or 'hear' people who aren't there.  Unless these visions are upsetting to the person who is dying, there is no need to be concerned.  At this point, you may want to ask, 'Tell me what you see?' This could provide an opportunity for your loved one to talk about their memories.  A person who is dying may have little appetite and may have trouble swallowing foods and even liquids.  They may have trouble speaking or concentrating.  They may and change in appearance, with their skin becoming bluish or darkening and they may experience weight loss and muscle thinning.  There are often involuntary muscle movements or restlessness, and loss of bowel or bladder function.</Content>

<Content id="0">If your loved one is receiving hospice care at home and you believe that they have died, you can contact the home healthcare provider or hospice agency. The hospice provider will help you make the phone calls to alert doctors, other healthcare providers, clergy and the funeral home.  They will also call to have any medical equipment that your loved one used taken away. They will remove any tubes, such as a catheter, and bathe and dress your loved one.  Remember that although death is expected, it is still normal to feel shock, disbelief, and grief.  You do not have to rush to contact a medical provider or call 911.  Many people find it comforting to spend some final peaceful moments with their loved one to say goodbye and accept their passing.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a hospice facility?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A hospice facility is a place where people who are believed to have less than 6 months to live can receive care for symptoms that cannot be treated in the home.  Once their symptoms are under control they are released and will receive hospice care at home.  Hospice facilities can be separate buildings or they can be a unit in a hospital or skilled nursing facility.  These facilities strive to provide a comfortable environment for the person who is dying and their loved ones to spend time together.  They usually have relaxed rules about visitation and let family bring in familiar items from home to comfort the person who is dying.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a nursing home?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A nursing home or skilled nursing facility provides non-emergency nursing and medical care and services to patients who do not require hospitalization.  Generally, a person would need a skilled nursing facility to help improve their condition, or maintain their current condition and prevent it from getting worse.  Medicare has specific rules about receiving hospice care while in a skilled nursing facility.  If a person has an injury or illness that is not related to their terminal illness they may receive hospice care in a skilled nursing facility if that facility has a contract with a hospice provider.  As in a hospital, skilled nursing facilities may have regulations about who can visit and when, as well as what types of items may be brought in for the comfort of the patient.  For more information on receiving care in a skilled nursing facility, look in the resources section.</Content>

<Content id="0">Depending on your illness and prognosis, you may be eligible to enroll in a clinical trial.  Typically, patients with terminal illnesses for whom there are thought to be no remaining standard treatments available can enroll in clinical trials that test the efficacy of treatments that are not yet approved for treating that particular illness.  These trials measure the effect of the treatment on the person's condition but are not expected to cure or significantly lengthen the dying person's life.  Clinical trials should be discussed with your physician.</Content>

<Content id="0">The options described in this program are meant to help you decide what is best.  There are no right or wrong answers and you can change your mind at any time, for any reason.  Also, these are not either or options. You can opt for some measures of medical care while receiving some comfort care measures as well.  Treatment can change based on changing circumstances, for example you can opt for medical treatment until you are certain it will not cure or halt the disease progression or until quality of life has gotten worse and cannot be made better.  Then, when you are ready, you can transition to more comfort measures and less medical measures.  Or, you may decide to use life extending treatments until a goal is reached. For instance, some people may decide to get full medical care until a birth or graduation, or a family trip, and then change to comfort only care when they are ready.</Content>

<Content id="0">Some facilities allow outside caregivers to provide companionship for the person who is dying.  This is helpful when loved ones cannot visit.  These aids cannot administer medical care, but can help with eating and drinking, personal grooming and other activities that improve emotional well-being.  If care is being provided at home, the hospice team can include caregivers and trained volunteers to help support the person who is dying and their family.  Volunteers can assist with shopping or light household chores, or they can spend time with the person who is dying to allow family caregivers to take care of necessary errands, or simply have some time alone.</Content>

Healthcare POAs differ from general power of attorney in that they do not cover power to make financial decisions.  Healthcare POAs are also called durable powers of attorney because they remain valid even after the person granting them dies or is unable to speak for themselves.   If you name someone as healthcare power of attorney, you will still make your own medical decisions until you are no longer able to.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a code status?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Code status refers to what measures should be taken if a persons' heart stops beating or their lungs stop working.
Full code means that healthcare providers may use chest compressions, electric shocks called defibrillation, and emergency medications that act to temporarily keep blood moving to essential organs such as the brain.  They may also perform intubation to assist with breathing.

Chemical code means that healthcare providers may give drugs during emergencies, but may not do chest compressions, breathing assistance, or electric shocks to the heart.  Everyone who comes into the hospital is considered full code until they either provide verbal or written instructions saying that they do not want measures taken to restart their heart.  If a person decides that they do not want emergency measures taken to restore their heartbeat or breathing, their code status will switch from full code to Do not resuscitate or Do not Intubate.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a living will?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A Living Will details a person's wishes for end-of-life care.  It is also referred to as an advance directive.  A living will can be created by anyone over the age of 18, at any time during their life.  A living will names a legal health care representative who can make care decisions for a person if they are not able to speak for themselves.  If a person has a living will and makes healthcare providers aware of it, it can help guide that person's treatment.  However, a living will does not impact the care that emergency medical technicians provide, so EMTs may still attempt to resuscitate a person even if that person's living will says that they do not want to be resuscitated.  Either a Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment or POLST form, or a nonhospital Do Not Resuscitate order are necessary to prevent EMTs from performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  Look in the related questions area for more information on POLST forms and Non hospital do not resuscitate orders.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment or POLST?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment or POLST, is an order from a doctor that details the wishes of seriously-ill people about end-of-life care, including medical treatment, advanced life saving measures such as a breathing machine, feeding tubes, and cardio pulmonary resuscitation or CPR.  The original POLST form is printed on bright pink paper, and signed by both a doctor and patient.  Photocopies or print outs can be made and kept with the patient across all care settings and in the home.  POLST differs from advanced directives or living wills in that it is created by the physician and the patient or the patient's surrogate decision maker and details the care plan that they have decided on.   Emergency medical personnel are trained to look for POLST documents on the refrigerator when responding to a person's home and to follow the care instructions in the order.  You will find links to POLST and other tools to document end-of-life decisions in the resources area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How do I document treatment decisions?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are several ways to document end-of-life decisions.  If a person is competent to make their own medical choices, they can have a living will drawn up by a lawyer and appoint a medical power of attorney to enforce their decisions.  They can also make use of available free forms to document their wishes.   Allegheny Health Network recognizes the Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment form or POLST, which is available in the resources area along with other free forms.  Family members can also use these tools if their loved one is not able to speak for themselves.   No matter what tool is used, it is important to make sure that the health care agent and healthcare providers are aware of these decisions.  You can print out the POLST or other forms and give them to a healthcare provider to be put in the medical chart. You may also want to ask about 'Do Not Resuscitate' and 'Do Not Intubate' orders if that fits in with your plans. For information on ensuring that your wishes are carried out no matter what facility you are in or who is taking care of you, see the topics in the related questions area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What if I have to call the ambulance or go to the Emergency Department?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Emergency medical technicians, or EMTs for short, paramedics, and other healthcare providers need to be aware of end-of-life wishes.  If care is being provided at home a do-not-resuscitate order will not be honored by emergency medical personnel.  A non-hospital do-not-resuscitate or out-of-hospital order is required  so that emergency responders do not perform CPR or other extreme measures to restart the heart or provide oxygen.  Emergency responders are trained to look for the non-hospital DNR or  Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment POLST on the refrigerator in the home and DNR bracelets are also available to let them know that no-life saving measures are wanted. If you are the health care agent, make sure a copy of the POLST is kept with the patient at all times.  Many agents keep a copy of the POLST and living will in their glove compartment.  These documents should be honored by all healthcare providers.</Content>

<Content id="0">A Do Not Resuscitate or Do Not Intubate order applies only to resuscitation or intubation and will not affect the other care that your loved one receives.  The only difference is that if the heart should stop beating there would be no effort to restart the heart through cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  Comfort Measures Only means that care will continue to be provided to ensure your loved one's comfort and will not affect the amount of attention paid to them.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is an ethics consultation?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">If family members or healthcare providers have difficulty making end-of-life decisions or don't agree on what treatment options are best, an ethics consultation can help to resolve issues.  Some common issues where an ethics consultation may be helpful are decisions about when life prolonging treatment such as a breathing machines, feeding tubes or dialysis be started, continued or stopped, deciding what to do when a patient refuses treatment that may be medically helpful, and determining who should make healthcare decisions for patients when they are unable or unwilling to decide for themselves.  In an ethics consultation a team of healthcare providers trained in ethics will meet with the family, doctors, nurses and social workers involved in the care of the patient. Patients and family members may ask any member of the healthcare team to initiate a consultation.  Look in the resources section for contact information.  An Ethics Committee representative will discuss the process with you, determine if you wish to pursue an ethics consultation and answer any questions you may have. There is no charge for ethics consultations.</Content>

<Content id="0">Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation or CPR is a life-saving measure that provides oxygen and blood circulation when a person's heart has stopped or they have stopped breathing.  It can provide temporary circulation until the heart can be restarted with an electric shock, called defibrillation, or until there is no hope of restoring a heartbeat and death is declared. The chest compressions performed during CPR must be done with force and may cause fractures to the ribs or sternum, especially in a person whose bones are fragile from age or illness.  Fractured ribs can puncture lungs or other organs and can cause considerable pain.  Even when a heartbeat is restored, a patient may still require artificial life support.</Content>

<Content id="0">The intensive Care Unit is part of the hospital where the most critically ill patients are cared for.  Nurses and physicians with specialized training provide constant monitoring and support in order to maintain normal functions.  It may also be called the critical care unit or CCU. The ICU is for patients who are receiving medical care with the goal of extending life.  In the ICU, every measure available to extend life will be taken unless otherwise specified.    Patients may be put on a ventilator to assist breathing through a tube placed in their mouth and throat, or through an opening made in the throat called a tracheotomy; the heart is monitored constantly and problems with heart function treated with external pacemakers or defibrillators. If there is kidney failure, dialysis is used to cleanse the blood.  Other bodily functions such as oxygen levels, blood pressure and temperature are monitored constantly. Intravenous, or IV lines are used to provide fluids and medications, feeding tubes provide nutrition if necessary, suction pumps, drains, and catheters handle fluids coming out of the body.  Medications are used to treat the underlying condition as well as to keep the patient unconscious during healing.  If extending life using all possible measures is not your treatment goal, ICU care may not be aligned with your wishes.</Content>

<Content id="0">Palliative chemotherapy is used in cases where the treatment is not expected to cure cancer but only to prolong life or improve symptoms.  When deciding whether chemotherapy is the right treatment choice there are 4 factors to consider:  The response rate of the chemotherapy, in other words how much will the tumor be affected by the treatment, how long will the response to chemotherapy last, what are the potential side effects of the treatment, and how long  treatment must continue.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is euthanasia?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Euthanasia is the act of assisting with the death of a hopelessly sick or injured person in a relatively painless way for reasons of mercy.  An assisted suicide is performed by the person who wishes to die, but this person is provided with the instructions, medication or other means of death by another person.  When the instructions, medication or other means of death are provided by a doctor, it is called physician assisted suicide.   Proponents of euthanasia believe that an individual has the right to decide when and how to die with dignity and in comfort.  Supportive care or Comfort Measures Only care is not euthanasia as both are intended to care for the person who is dying, not hasten or cause their death.</Content>

They are used to treat low blood pressure, called hypotension, especially in critically ill patients.  Common side effects are nausea and vomiting, rapid heartbeat, called tachycardia, tremors, and lower levels of infection fighting white blood cells and red blood cells that help stop bleeding.  The levels of these important blood cells can be restored if the medication is stopped.</Content>

<Content id="0">Extraordinary measures are any medical procedure which, in the case of a terminally ill patient, will only prolong the process of dying when death is expected to occur soon.  Palliative or hospice care are not extraordinary measures as they are not meant to extend life.  Examples of extraordinary measures are ventilators to take over natural breathing or cardiopulmonary resuscitation to keep the heart beating.</Content>

<Content id="0">Goals of care refer to what the patient or family member sees as the desired outcome of their medical care.  Possible goals for care are prevention, cure, extending life, or achieving a pain free death.   A person may have multiple goals at the same time.  For example, attempts to cure an illness can be made at the same time as efforts to relieve suffering and improve quality of life.  Or, if someone has a personal goal that they want to reach such as getting their finances in order or seeing a loved one graduate, they can receive life extending treatment and supportive care until that goal is achieved, then begin palliative care alone when they feel ready.</Content>

<Content id="0">Paying for medical care is often of great concern at the end-of-life.  We want the best care possible, but there are often very real financial concerns.  Depending on what kind of medical insurance is involved, some services may be covered, others covered only partly, and others not at all.  We've provided links to information on Medicare and VA coverage in the Resources section.  If you have private insurance, you should contact your insurer's member benefits area to find out what kind of coverage you have and what it will pay for.   If you are uninsured and unable to pay for medical care, Allegheny Health Network has programs that can help meet your needs.  Look in the resources section for contact information.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What if my loved one lives longer than 6 months of hospice care allowed by Medicare?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">If a person who is dying is in hospice for longer than 6 months Medicare may still cover their hospice care, but doctors must reverify that the person is still in the last stages of dying and not expected to live longer than 6 months.  If someone's condition stabilizes while they are in hospice care and it is no longer believed that they will likely die in 6 months, they can be discharged from hospice.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What if my other family members don't agree with my decision?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">It can be difficult for family members to agree on care for their loved one who is dying.  Everyone comes to acceptance of death in a different way and at a different pace.  If one person has been closer to and providing more care for a loved one, they may more readily accept the doctor's prognosis, while others may not be in agreement and see discontinuing medical care as giving up.  Other family issues can complicate discussions and decisions around end-of-life as well.  We hope that by sharing this program with everyone involved in the decision process, you can resolve any differences among family members. Preparing an advance directive or living will and discussing it with those closest to you is an excellent way to communicate your wishes.  Talking with social workers, clergy, the supportive care team or the ethics committee can also help families reach agreement.</Content>

<Content id="0">Although we may want to shield children from the sadness of losing a loved one, children very often are more aware of what is going on than we think, so it is important to explain death in terms that are appropriate for the age and understanding of the child.  By talking simply and openly about death, we can help address their fears and concerns.  When having a discussion about death with a child it is important to keep an open mind, just like adults, each child deals with grief in their own way.  They may respond with more questions, cry, or withdraw to think about their feelings.  Check in the resources section for helpful guides on talking to children about death.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How do I talk to my loved one about dying?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">End-of-life discussions can be uncomfortable for the person who is dying as well as for family members, caregivers and other loved ones.  The person who is dying may wish to spare their loved ones the certain knowledge that they are dying, and caregivers may be uncomfortable thinking about the fact they too will die one day, or they may not want to break down or upset their loved one by showing too much emotion.  Although it can be difficult, most people are relieved to be talking openly about death.  It's important to let the other person know how you are feeling about having this discussion, be open about your emotions, your needs and what you're able to handle.  Some people need to talk about their feelings, beliefs and fears around dying, others may prefer only succinct, factual discussions.  Open communication is the key to any end-of-life discussion.  You may want to open the conversation by saying that you want to make sure that your loved one's wishes are honored should they not be able to tell others what they want.  Social workers, clergy, or the supportive care team can also be helpful with this. There is more information on having end-of-life discussions in the resources section.</Content>

<Content id="0">It is especially hard to have end-of-life discussions with our loved ones whose mental capacity is affected by their illness to the point where they may not understand what is being said to them.  Many life-limiting conditions can cause confusion, irritability, hallucinations, and difficulty thinking.  This can be very distressing for both the person who is dying and loved ones.  If your loved one does not have a living will, you may be called on to make decisions about their medical care without knowing what their wishes are.   The emotional impact of making these decisions can be traumatic, so you should gather as much support around you as you can.   Other family members, clergy, social and hospice workers and the healthcare and supportive care team can be very helpful in accepting your role in making medical decisions when your loved one is not able to think or communicate effectively.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What if a member of the medical team disagrees with our decision?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Even though they are around people who are dying and see death more often than most, doctors have the same feelings about death as non-doctors us do.  They may see discontinuing medical treatment as giving up, or they may not want the patient to feel as though they've been abandoned or forgotten.   A doctor's values and beliefs about life and death may be different from yours.  Because of this it is important to document your wishes and express them clearly to the doctor. If your doctor disagrees with your treatment choices, you should ask them why they disagree and restate your goals.  If after discussing your wishes with the doctor there is still a dispute, the hospital ethics committee can speak with everyone and help reach agreement.   Doctors do have the right to refuse care if it violates their personal standards or those of the facility, in this case they must notify you immediately and help arrange for you to receive care from another doctor or facility.</Content>

<Content id="0">In the ICU, patients may be put on a ventilator to assist breathing through a tube inserted through the airway or small incision in the throat.  They may have many lines, tubes or wires attached to them.  Some are wires for monitoring the heart and other bodily functions.   Others may be Intravenous lines to provide fluids and medications; feeding tubes to provide nutrition; and suction pumps, drains, and catheters to handle fluids coming out of the body.

Patients may be given medications that put them into a temporary coma to help them heal.  Strong pain relievers and medicines for sleep are also commonly used.  Many patients in the ICU have facial swelling due to medications or from injury, and they may have bruising from blood tests, or clotting problems.   Patients in the ICU are seriously ill and may not be able to think clearly or talk.   Medications and toxins in their blood may also cause disorientation, confusion or even hostility.  When visiting someone in the ICU, you may be asked to leave during certain medical procedures, such as insertion of a urinary catheter.   Visiting hours are usually very strict and the patient may not be able to have more than one or two visitors at a time.</Content>

If the family members do not agree on treatment goals, they may be referred to the ethics committee.  If agreement still cannot be reached legal guardianship may need to be established.  In order to become a legal guardian, one must go to court and using testimony from healthcare providers, prove that their loved one who is dying is not able to make rational decisions about their healthcare, the court then appoints a guardian.  This can be a difficult and lengthy process, especially if family members are not in agreement over their loved one's ability to make decisions or which one of them should be appointed guardian.</Content>

These are natural emotional responses to illness or death and they should fade over time.  If your bereavement lasts longer than several months and keeps you from resuming your own life, you may need to see a therapist. This is called complicated grief and you can find more information on symptoms in the resources section.  If your loved one has had hospice care, you can ask for help from a bereavement counselor for up to a year, or your insurance company should be able to make you a referral to a behavioral health specialist who can help.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What if I can't provide the care at home like I thought?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Not everyone has the resources or ability to provide care in their home for a loved one who is dying.  There are many things to consider, including:

Who is going to care for the physical needs of the person,
Whether there is room for the necessary medical equipment,
and, how caring for a person who is dying will affect other family member's

If you cannot care for your loved one at home, it is best to let them know up front rather than taking on too much.  You need to take care of yourself and your family through this process as well.  Remember that if you're not caring for yourself, you will not be able to provide the best care for your loved one.   If you are unable to care for your loved one at home, they can be transferred to a hospice care facility, or depending on their symptoms, a skilled nursing facility.  A social worker or hospice worker can help explain the need for this move to your loved one.  Hospice and skilled nursing facilities provide excellent care so there is no need to worry that your loved one will not be well taken care of.</Content>

<Content id="0">Everyone copes differently with death and you may experience many unexpected emotions, from fear to sadness and even anger.  You may also feel numb or disconnected.  Physical symptoms such as nausea, headaches, fatigue and muscle aches are common when dealing with the stress of grieving.   Your emotions may change suddenly, leaving you feeling like you're on an emotional roller coaster. These feelings are all normal, and you should not feel guilty if you experience some emotions that seem inappropriate. Talking through your feelings with a trusted loved one, clergy member or counselor can be very helpful in reducing stress.  It is important to allow yourself to feel these very normal emotions and understand when grief impacts your ability to function.  Normally grief resolves itself, but speak to a grief counselor if you are unable to perform your usual daily activities while you are grieving.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How do I address spiritual concerns?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">	Many people have spiritual concerns when facing end-of-life decisions.  Your religious beliefs may be an important part of your decision to continue full medical care, or to choose palliative care.  One of the goals of Supportive Care is to address your spiritual needs, so it is important that you voice any concerns that you have to your healthcare providers.  Your healthcare providers should be respectful of your spiritual beliefs even if they do not share them.   We have put together a list of resources and ideas for addressing spiritual concerns that you will find in the Resources section.  And we have asked others who have experienced making end-of-life decisions to talk about how their beliefs were addressed during this time.   Here are their answers.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a ventilator?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A ventilator is a machine that breathes for a person who is not able to breathe for themselves. It supplies oxygen to the lungs and removes carbon dioxide.  When a patient is on a ventilator, a tube is placed into the windpipe. The tube may go through the mouth first, or be inserted through a small opening in the patient's throat, called a tracheotomy.   Patients on ventilators are not able to speak and may have to be fed through an intravenous, or IV line, or through a feeding tube.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Addressing spiritual needs</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Addressing spiritual needs can be as important to quality of life as giving medications and physical comfort.  It may help the person who is dying to talk with clergy, family or a friend about any fears or concerns they may have about dying.  Prayer and meditation may also comfort both the person who is dying and their family.   As life comes to an end, people may have the need to connect with others and to repair or enhance relationships.  Telling a person who is dying about how they have touched your life can help them find meaning and value in their life.    If you are able to talk with your loved one about their memories, it may be a good time to write them down or record them.</Content>
