<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a clinical study?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A clinical study, also called a clinical trial, examines the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug that may treat or prevent a disease or symptom. A clinical study follows a pre-defined research plan called a protocol. Researchers conduct several phases of clinical studies to make sure an investigational drug is safe and effective for people to use. When these studies are completed, regulatory agencies review study results and decide if the investigational drug should be approved and made available to the general public. NODE-1 is a clinical study testing an investigational drug called etripamil to see if it is safe and effective at ending an episode of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, or PSVT. </Content>

<Content id="0">The different designs or types of clinical studies are described using words like "comparative," "double blind," "single blind," and "open-label." These are discussed in detail in the related questions menu on the right. The NODE-1 study is a randomized, double-blind, comparative study that is testing an investigational drug called etripamil. In NODE-1, etripamil is being compared to a placebo to see if it is safe and effective in terminating an episode of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, or PSVT. A participant in the NODE-1 study has an 80 percent chance of receiving etripamil and a 20 percent chance of receiving placebo.</Content>

<Content id="0">A research team that includes doctors, nurses, research assistants, data analysts, and other specialists manages the study. Your heart doctor is an electrophysiologist, a cardiologist with advanced training, and is the same doctor who will perform your ablation. He or she leads the research team in the electrophysiology room and is ultimately responsible for your safety during the study and ablation procedure. If at any time you feel too uncomfortable or if your heart doctor determines that your condition is unsafe, he or she will stop the paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, or PSVT, immediately with the usual procedures using the catheters already placed in your heart.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC)? Was NODE-1 approved by an IRB?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">An Institutional Review Board or Ethics Review Board is a committee at an institution such as a hospital or medical clinic that is charged with approving, monitoring, and reviewing clinical research involving people. The main goal of the committee is to make sure the study is ethical and the rights and welfare of participants are protected. Among other things, this includes making sure that research risks are minimized and are reasonable in relation to any potential benefits. Before a clinical study starts, this committee will conduct a risk-benefit analysis to determine whether the research should be performed. Several institutional review boards approved the NODE-1 study. The study doctor is your heart doctor and is the person who will perform your ablation. He or she has obtained approval to conduct the NODE-1 study at his or her hospital or institution. </Content>

<Content id="0">In order to conduct a clinical study, the research team must agree to comply with ethical guidelines and laws designed to protect patient volunteers, as well as to preserve the integrity of the research. One of the main points of the ethical guidelines is that individuals should be treated with respect from the time they are approached for possible participation in the study, throughout their participation, and after their participation ends. This includes, but is not limited to, your right to privacy and respecting your right to change your mind about being in the study at any point. </Content>

<Content id="0">Under the terms of the ethical guidelines and laws that govern clinical studies, all researchers must inform participants of the potential risks and benefits associated with participation in a clinical study, as well as available alternatives. Because NODE-1 is a double-blind study, the study team will not be able to tell you which study drug you are receiving in order to preserve the scientific integrity of the study. However, this information can be communicated to the study team if there is a medical need to know this information.  </Content>

<Content id="0">Randomization is the process by which study participants are assigned by chance to one of the study treatments. This process allows researchers to compare the safety and efficacy of different study drugs, including a placebo, without bias. In NODE-1, each participant is randomized to receive one of four doses of the investigational drug nasal spray, etripamil, or placebo, a spray that looks like etripamil but has no active ingredients. </Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is informed consent?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Laws and ethical guidelines governing clinical research in many countries around the world require that prospective study participants be given relevant information about the proposed study through a process known as "informed consent." This process is designed to accurately inform individuals of the study purpose, procedures, risks, benefits, and alternatives. The informed consent process also ensures that participants understand information about the study and how it relates to their own health or interests. It also provides the opportunity for individuals to make voluntary and informed decisions about whether or not to participate in the study. Once you have had time to read and understand the informed consent form and discuss it with your heart doctor and the rest of the study team, you will be in a better position to decide if you wish to participate in the study. If you choose to participate, you will sign the informed consent form. Even if you sign the form, you can still withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason.  </Content>

<Content id="0">Whether or not to take part in a clinical study is your decision. As a study participant you have certain rights. For example, you are to be given enough time to decide whether to participate and to make that decision without any pressure from the study team. You can also refuse to participate in the study or stop participating at any time. Your decision not to participate will not affect your right to your usual care. The plan for your ablation will be unaffected by whether or not you participate in the study. In addition, you have the right to be told why the clinical study is being done, what will happen, and what you will be asked to do if you are in the study. You will also be informed of any reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, or side effects that may occur during the study and who will pay for any treatment related to the clinical research. You have the right to have your questions answered by the study team at any time and to receive a copy of your signed informed consent form.  </Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the purpose of the NODE-1 study?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The purpose of the NODE-1 study is to evaluate whether an investigational drug called etripamil is safe and whether it may stop an episode of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, or PSVT. Etripamil is a nasal spray that is absorbed through the nostrils. In this study, four different doses of etripamil will be compared to a placebo, which looks like etripamil but contains no active ingredients. If you participate in NODE-1, the study is conducted during your electrophysiology study, which is done just before your ablation procedure in order to identify and locate the source of your PSVT. Your heart doctor will perform the ablation as planned regardless of whether you decide to take part in the NODE-1 study.</Content>

<Content id="0">Participants will not be informed about study results while the study is ongoing. NODE-1 study results will be published in a scientific journal several months after the study closes. If the investigational drug, etripamil, is found to be safe and effective in the NODE-1 study, additional studies will be done to test it in a larger number of people with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, or PSVT. After all the necessary studies are successfully completed, all study data will be presented to regulatory agencies that will decide if etripamil is safe and effective to treat episodes of PSVT in the general public. This entire process usually takes several years.</Content>

The purpose of the NODE-1 study is to evaluate whether a nasal spray investigational drug called etripamil is safe and whether it may stop an episode of PSVT. This study is a required step to develop a new treatment for PSVT that can be self-administered at home when PSVT symptoms appear. A treatment option that can be administered at home is desirable because current treatment options for a long episode of PSVT require patients to go to the emergency room.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a placebo?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical studies often compare the investigational drug to a placebo. A placebo looks similar to the investigational drug but has no active ingredients. These studies are called "placebo-controlled." Patients participating in a placebo-controlled study are told during the informed consent process that there is a chance that they could receive the investigational drug or a placebo. Comparing the effects of an investigational drug to the effects of a placebo helps researchers find out if the investigational drug is safe and effective at treating the condition being studied. The NODE-1 study is testing four different doses of an investigational drug called etripamil against a placebo to see if it is safe and effective in terminating an episode of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, or PSVT. In the NODE-1 study, one out of every five participants will receive placebo. In other words, a NODE-1 study participant has an 80 percent chance of receiving the investigational drug, etripamil, and a 20 percent chance of receiving placebo. If you receive placebo, it may be less likely that your PSVT episode will stop on its own, and your heart doctor may need to stop it with the usual procedures using the catheters already placed in your heart.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, also called PSVT, occurs due to an abnormality in the electrical system of the heart. People with this condition have episodes of rapid heart rate. These episodes typically start and stop without warning. A normal resting heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute, but heart rates during an episode of PSVT may range from 125 to 300 beats per minute. PSVT is not typically life threatening, but the associated symptoms may be uncomfortable. This may impact a patient's lifestyle by limiting certain physical activities.   </Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What treatments are available for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, or PSVT, can stop on their own or can sometimes be stopped by taking certain actions. Some examples of actions that may stop an episode of PSVT include holding your breath and straining as if you were trying to have a bowel movement, coughing while sitting with your upper body bent forward, or splashing ice water on your face. If the episode does not stop in a reasonable time frame, intravenous medication can be given in the emergency room. Long-term treatments for people who have repeat episodes of PSVT may include taking regular medications to reduce the frequency of episodes. For some patients, catheter ablation can permanently correct the abnormality in the electrical system of the heart. The NODE-1 study is evaluating whether an investigational nasal spray drug called etripamil can safely and effectively stop an episode of PSVT. Etripamil is thought to work similarly to some other medications that are already given to PSVT patients intravenously in emergency rooms, but it is a nasal spray that patients may be able to self-administer at home when PSVT symptoms appear. </Content>

<Content id="0">Catheter ablation is a medical procedure used to treat many types of arrhythmias, including paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, or PSVT. During an ablation, a heart doctor trained in cardiac electrophysiology first places small wires called catheters into the heart. The doctor then induces an episode of PSVT to examine the electrical system of the heart and locate the abnormality causing the PSVT. Finally, the doctor uses the catheters to destroy the tissue that is causing the PSVT without damaging the rest of the heart.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Is there a placebo in the NODE-1 study? What can happen if I receive the placebo?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Placebo is used in this study. A placebo looks like the investigational drug, but has no active ingredients. Comparing the effects of an investigational drug to the effects of placebo helps researchers find out if an investigational drug is safe and effective for the condition being studied. If you participate in the NODE-1 study, you will be randomly assigned to receive either the investigational drug or placebo. You will not know which study drug you receive, but you have an 80 percent chance of receiving the investigational drug and a 20 percent chance of receiving placebo. If you receive placebo, it may be less likely that your episode of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, or PSVT, will stop on its own, and your heart doctor may need to stop it with the usual procedures using the catheters already placed in your heart. An electrophysiology study is always done right before an ablation to identify and locate the source of the PSVT. Therefore, the process of starting and stopping your PSVT episode through the catheters is the same process for any ablation, whether or not you participate in the NODE-1 study. If you participate in NODE-1, the total length of your induced PSVT episode will be longer than what is typical during an ablation procedure.</Content>

If etripamil is found to be safe and effective in the NODE-1 study, additional studies will be done to test etripamil in a larger number of people with PSVT. After all the necessary studies are successfully completed, all study data will be presented to regulatory agencies that will decide if etripamil can be approved as a medication that should be made available to the general public. </Content>

<Content id="0">An electrophysiology study, including induction of an episode of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, or PSVT, is always done just before an ablation procedure in order to identify and locate the source of the PSVT. This electrophysiology study will be done even if you chose not to participate in the NODE-1 study. If you participate in the NODE-1 study, your episode of PSVT will last longer than what is typical during an electrophysiology study. In the NODE-1 study, it is necessary to induce or start an episode of PSVT because the goal of the study is to determine if an episode can be stopped after the administration of the investigational drug, etripamil. In the NODE-1 study, your heart doctor will induce an episode of PSVT similar to the ones you experienced on your own. The PSVT episode will be sustained for at least five minutes, and then you will receive the study drug as a nasal spray in your nostrils.
