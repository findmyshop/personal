<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a clinical research study?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A clinical research study, also called a clinical trial, looks at an investigational treatment to see if it is safe, how it works in the body, and if it works to treat a disease. Clinical studies are run by qualified doctors who are responsible for the study participants' study-related care. In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, requires several phases of clinical research to help develop new treatments. </Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How are clinical studies regulated? How are participants protected?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical study are regulated in several ways to protect study participants.

Each clinical study follows a carefully controlled written research plan called a protocol, which describes what researchers will do in the study. The protocol includes safeguards like participant eligibility requirements to ensure the safety of study participants and protect their interests.

All clinical studies and their protocols are also overseen by regulatory agencies around the world that help protect the interests and safety of study participants. In the United States, clinical research is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, often referred to as the FDA. Clinical studies in the United States are also monitored by an Institutional Review Board, also called an IRB, which is a committee of independent doctors and members of the community who help review clinical research to ensure the rights of study participants are protected.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the common types of clinical research studies?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are two main types of clinical studies: Placebo-controlled studies and head-to-head studies.

A placebo-controlled study means that one group of patients will receive the investigational drug, while a second group, known as the control group, will receive placebo. This placebo usually looks like the investigational drug but is designed to have no effect on patients.

In a head-to-head study, one group of patients receives the investigational drug, while a second group of patients receives a different treatment. This allows researchers to compare the investigational drug to other treatments, which are often standard of care treatments already used to treat a given disease. There is no placebo in a head-to-head study, and each patient has a chance of receiving either the investigational drug or another treatment.</Content>

<Content id="0">A placebo looks like the investigational drug, but is designed to have no effect on patients. Placebos are used in placebo-controlled studies where some participants receive placebo while others receive the investigational drug. This direct comparison helps the researchers see the effects of the investigational drug while also controlling for the "placebo effect," which refers to any effect of study participation that is not caused by the actual investigational drug. </Content>

<Content id="0">In randomized studies, there is no way to ensure a participant gets a particular study treatment.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is informed consent?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The informed consent process explains key information about a particular clinical research study, including the purpose of the research, its potential risks and benefits, and what is required of study participants. This process is intended to help people make an informed decision about whether to participate in a particular clinical study.

Before joining any clinical study, potential participants who are age 18 or older are required to sign an informed consent form to acknowledge that they were informed about the study and agreed to participate in the research. For children who are younger than 18 years old, a parent or guardian will be required to sign the informed consent form for their child. Children may also be asked to sign an informed assent form, which contains information similar to that in the informed consent form.

Participants can still choose to leave the study at any time, for any reason, even after signing the consent form.</Content>

Study participants always have the right to stop participating at any time and for any reason without any effect on their routine medical care.

Participants have the right to be told why the clinical study is being done, what will happen, and what will be asked of them in the study, as well as any reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, or side effects that may occur during the study. The study team must also answer all of a participant's questions at any time and provide a copy of the signed informed consent form.</Content>

<Content id="0">The Shine study will evaluate whether Vyvanse&#174;, a central nervous system stimulant, is safe and effective in treating ADHD in children who are 4 or 5 years old. Vyvanse&#174; has already been approved to treat ADHD in adults and children 6 of age and older. Because Vyvanse&#174; has not been approved to treat children who are younger than 6 years of age, it is considered investigational in this study. Vyvanse&#174; is taken by mouth.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Will participants have to switch from their regular doctors once enrolled in a study?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There is no reason why a participant should switch his or her regular care to the study doctor.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is blinding? Why is a study blinded?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical studies, are often described as being "single-blind" or "double-blind."

A single-blind study means that the study researchers know what study treatment each participant is getting, but the participants do not.

In a double-blind study, neither the researchers nor the study participants know which study treatment each participant is receiving.

Studies are blinded to avoid bias and ensure that study results are not affected by researcher or participant beliefs about what study results will show.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why is clinical research important?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical research studies help determine if investigational medications and treatments are safe and effective. Before any treatment is made available to the general public, it has to go through several phases of clinical research and regulatory approvals. Every medicine and treatment available today is the result of past clinical studies. Without clinical research, there would be no medical advancements.</Content>
