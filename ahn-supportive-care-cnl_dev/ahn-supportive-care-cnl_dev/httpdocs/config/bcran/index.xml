<BaseQuestion id="0">What is the BRCA gene?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The BRCA [or Brach-ah gene] is actually two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA 2 and these are genes that are involved in DNA repair.  If there are mutations in these genes, which we see in 5 to 10% of all breast cancer, that can predispose to breast cancer, and we talk about cancer running in families and this is one of the gene sets that may be responsible for that.  We know that these genes can be inherited either from a patient's mother or from a patient's father.  Sometimes people think that breast cancer only spreads through the maternal side, but that actually isn't correct.  You have equal chance of either one of these genes being from either your mother or your father; and if either your mother or your father have one of these genes, the chances that you would have one of these genes is about 50%.
Why having a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 is important is because these mutations predispose to early onset breast cancer, bilateral breast cancer, as well as other cancers, in particular ovarian cancer.  Patients who have a BRCA mutation may choose to have bilateral mastectomies instead of a single mastectomy or a single breast surgery, and in some cases we will recommend that patients have their ovaries removed as a preventative surgery as well.
Currently we have not only BRCA1 and BRCA2 as genes that have been associated with breast cancer, there are actually a number of genes that have been recently discovered as potentially leading to an increased risk of breast cancer or early onset breast cancer.  Sometimes the genetic counselor or your physician will talk to you about doing panel testing.  What panel testing involves is looking at over 20 genes that have been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.  There are both pros and cons to panel genetic testing and this is something that will be discussed further with you if you are eligible for this testing.  Patients who we refer for genetic counseling or patients who we test for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations are generally patients who have early onset breast cancer defined as breast cancer before the age of 45, women who have had cancer in both breasts or bilateral breast cancer, and also women who have had two or more family members with breast cancer, or one family member with ovarian cancer.  These are all potential red flags that would lead us to consider that it may be that your breast cancer could be responsible for one of these mutations.

There are a number of genes that can be associated with and increased risk of breast cancer.  These include BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, but there are over 20 other genes that we can test for if clinically indicated.  This can be done either through a blood test or a saliva test.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why would you recommend neoadjuvant therapy to one of your patients?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Generally, we recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy to patients trying to capitalize on the effectiveness of neoadjuvant therapy for shrinking tumors and converting the patients from mastectomy to breast conserving surgery.  But again, not everybody that is a candidate for neoadjuvant chemotherapy has to be a mastectomy candidate.  We also can downstage the disease in the lymph nodes.  So a patient is likely to have positive nodes, (either because we feel a node under the armpit, or because we did a biopsy up front and we know that the patient has a positive node), we can convert this patient to negative disease in the nodes, and therefore, spare them potentially from a full axillary dissection.  Anybody that we can potentially minimize the extent of surgery would be a good candidate for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

There are certain types of breast cancer that respond particularly well to chemotherapy, such as patients who have her2 positive disease or triple negative breast cancer and for those patients sometimes in particular we will often consider neoadjuvant chemotherapy in part because those tumors are likely to respond very well.  We also know that the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with long term  prediction of outcome as far as prevention of breast cancer recurrence.

In many cases, if a patient is eligible for a treatment after surgery, such as chemotherapy or Herceptin based therapies, they also may have the option of receiving that treatment before surgery. There are some cancers, particularly HER2+ or triple negative that respond dramatically to chemotherapy with Herceptin (if indicated) and in many circumstances it is preferable to get the treatment prior to surgery. In addition, how well the cancers respond to the treatment, can predict overall breast cancer outcome and risk of later reoccurrence. Also as previously reviewed, patients whose lymph nodes become negative after treatment, may not need as much surgery and patients who would otherwise require a mastectomy, can be downstaged to a lumpectomy.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How does my doctor benefit from me being in a clinical trial?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Both patients and physicians can benefit from clinical trial participation.  The way that your doctor may benefit from you being in a clinical trial is that hopefully the information learned from the clinical trial helps your doctor take better care of patients in the future.  And what we learn about today in clinical trials are treatments that have the potential to be better treatments and even cures for cancer in the future.

The way that I benefit from my patients participating in a clinical trial is that I know that I'm giving my patients the best possible treatment available.  We always have standard treatments and for many patients standard treatments are appropriate, however for other patients or other patient circumstances, being in a clinical trial is really the best option.  So as a physical I feel that when my patient is participating in a clinical trial I'm really giving them cutting edge, state-of-the-art treatment.  So I know that we're really doing our best and helping not only the patient do their best but also help patients who are to come and helping patients do better over the long term.

In terms of financial compensation, both your physician and the university do receive a small amount of compensation to cover the costs associated with clinical trials.  There are costs associated with the Institutional Review Board, there are also costs associated with the clinical trial nursing and this allows this to be something that we can continue to offer our patients.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are Oncotype, MammaPrint and Prosigna</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Oncotype, MammaPrint and Prosigna are all types of genomic assays that we use to identify which ER positive cancers have a higher likelihood of recurrence and may benefit from additional treatment, namely chemotherapy.  These tests are performed from the biopsy or from the resected tumor specimen, and these are tests that are performed in patients who are hormone receptor or ER or PR positive that also have 0 to 3 lymph nodes positive.  These tests look at the level of important genes that determine the likelihood of the cancer to spread and the potential benefits of hormone therapy or chemotherapy.  There are nuances as to which test may be ordered for you and your physician can discuss with you which test is best in your specific case.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What new research is happening around breast cancer?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are a number of exciting clinical trials that we have going on really at any given time.  One area of research that we are particularly interested in currently is the use of immunotherapy.  Immunotherapy has made great successes in cancers such as lung cancer and melanoma and we are also studying immunotherapy for breast cancer.  Particularly one type of breast cancer that has been difficult to treat is triple negative breast cancer.  And there is some early data that suggests that immunotherapy, particularly combined with either chemotherapy or vaccine therapy may be particularly useful in patients who have triple negative breast cancer.

We are also focusing currently on the notion of de-escalation, so trying to sort out which patients my actually require less therapy so that we can prevent over treatment and therefore limit the amount of toxicities that patients have from their treatments.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is genetic testing</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Not all patients with breast cancer will need to undergo genetic testing especially if diagnosed at an older age or with limited other cancers in their family. Generally genetic testing is considered if diagnosed younger than age 45, if there is breast and ovarian cancer in your family or if more than 2 women in a family have breast cancer. Ask your doctor if your family history qualifies you for referral for genetic testing.

Patients that qualify for genetic testing may have the option to do something called "panel testing" which can look at over 20 genes associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.  Testing includes the BCRA1 and BCRA2 genes, and PALB2.  One downside to panel testing is that because it is newer, we do not have a lot of long term follow up data to know the exact risks with each of these genes, so sometimes patients are left with more questions than answers.</Content>

<Content id="0">The type and severity of the side effects you will have while on a clinical trial depends on the type of medication being tested and the type of medication you are receiving. Your doctors will explain the possible side effects to you and will monitor you closely. If you find that the side effects are unacceptable to you or become intolerable during the trial, you always have the choice to stop participating in the trial.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is cancer?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Cancer is not just one disease but many diseases.   Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. Normally, your body forms new cells as you need them, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor.  There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Most cancers are named for the organ or type of cell in which they start ≠ for example, cancer that begins in the colon is called colon cancer.  When a cancer that starts in one place spreads to another, it's called metastases. This site discusses clinical trials that are designed to find improved treatments for breast cancer.</Content>

<Content id="0">The chances of fertility to be affected by cancer treatment are the same for patients on a clinical trial compared to patients receiving standard treatment. Chemotherapy can stop ovaries from working for a while, or in some cases permanently. It depends on the treatment if infertility is temporary or permanent. Permanent infertility is more likely in older women, especially when women are at an age when menopause would naturally occur.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What can patients expect if they receive adjuvant treatment?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Adjuvant therapy is given to reduce the chance of the cancer from coming back. It is given after the primary treatment, or surgery, is done. Depending on the specific breast cancer type, different kinds of adjuvant therapies may be given, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy or targeted therapy.

Chemotherapy uses drugs that affect the entire body and kills cancer cells no matter where they are located.

Hormone therapy treats breast cancer that responds to hormones such as estrogen.

Radiation therapy uses X≠rays to kill cancer cells. Adjuvant radiation therapy focuses on the area around the original cancer site to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back at that site.

Immunotherapy for breast cancer is used on specific types of breast cancer, for example HER≠2 positive breast cancer. Herceptin is an immunotherapy drug called an antibody that binds specifically to the HER≠2 protein sitting on the surface of breast cancer cells.

Targeted therapy includes drugs that work to prevent specific functions in the cancer cells that are unique to a type of breast cancer.

Every adjuvant therapy can cause different side effects. Ask your doctor for the side effects that you can expect if you receive adjuvant therapy.</Content>

<Content id="0">Once you decide to participate in a trial, you will be asked to sign a consent form.  Treatment will usually begin within a few days after the consent has been signed.  However, it may be necessary to have additional testing performed related to your participation before treatment begins.

[Dr. Bonaventura]
When I think a patient is a candidate for a clinical trial, what I normally do is explain the trial to them, and explain the rationale for the trial. Then what we do is we sit, we go through the consent form, and we go through what exactly the patient will have to deal with when she or he becomes involved in this trial. Is blood work going to be drawn? Are X-Rays going to be taken? Will measurements be taken? Whatever the trial involves, we go through that. The goal is to prepare the patient for exactly what will happen to him or her.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How are patients selected for a treatment trial?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Patients are selected for clinical trials by a series of what we call eligibility criteria. Sometimes these criteria seem sort of strict, but most of the time they're fairly straightforward. You have to have, usually, a certain stage of breast cancer, either stages I, II, or III, in some cases stage IV breast cancer. You have to generally be healthy. You have to have certain lab tests that are normal. Functions of your blood and of your liver have to be normal. And you have to have certain other criteria that are met for enrollment in the trial. One of the biggest ones is that you really have to agree to want to participate in the trial. We try to select women who are motivated. But nine times out of ten, women ask me, Is this going to be more work for me? And, it really isn't. I think the best clinical trials, the kind of trials we try to have women participate in, are the kind of trials that are basically standard of care plus something else. That's what I always tell people. It's standard of care, you get the normal care, but you, have a 50 percent or even greater chance, of getting something beyond the standard of care, that I think most women would really like to have.</Content>

However, if you are part of a non-randomized trial, you will always receive the experimental treatment.</Content>

<Content id="0">Clinical trials come about because of the intellectual curiosity of physicians who see patients with problems. They'll see a patient with a problem, and wonder is there a drug that can be used to help this person, to change their lifespan, to make it longer? Is there a drug, or a technique that can be used to give them a better quality of life for the amount of time that we  know they're going to have living with this disease? And it's just there,; it's just the doctors, PhDs, who develop various technologies, who have an intellectual curiosity about changing the issues that human beings have to deal with.</Content>

<Content id="0">Even before the trial starts, the researchers must get approval from the Institutional Review Board, an organization made up of doctors, researchers, and community leaders, regarding safety and privacy concerns.  During a clinical trial, the researchers are required to report to a Data Safety and Monitoring Board if any problems arise.  If you have any worries about safety, talk with your doctor or nurse.

[Dr. Bonaventura]
here are rules and regulations for clinical trials, and in institutions there is something called the IRB, or the Institutional Review Board, which looks at "What you want to do?" "How you want to do it?" "What is the patient population?" "How is the drug going to be administered?"  "What is the technique that's going to be used?"  And this board is made up of physicians, scientists, sometimes laypeople, sometimes nurses. It's an entire group of people who, sit and look at what the person wants to study, and how they want to study it. It's this group of people who sign off on the study before it even gets to the general population.</Content>

<Content id="0">The consent form is the primary safeguard for participants. It is the job of your research team to make sure that you understand what the study is about so that you can make a well-informed decision.  You can talk to anyone on your team if you have any questions or need more information.  Signing the consent form means that you understand the risks and benefits of the trial and you agree to begin participating in it.  You should not sign the consent form until you understand it. However, you are not signing a contract.  You are free to stop participating in the trial at any time you choose.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why is a consent form so long?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">In order to protect people who may enter clinical trials, doctors are required to fully explain what happens in the trial.  Consent forms can seem overwhelming since they contain a lot of information.  Your physician and study nurse will spend as much time as needed explaining the study and answering your questions.  It is also helpful to take the consent form home with you so that you can review it in a more relaxed setting.  Your family members may also want to review the consent form.  You should not sign the consent form until you understand it.  Signing the consent form means that you understand the risks and benefits of the trial and that you agree to begin participation in the trial.

Dr. Bonaventura:
When I offer a patient a clinical trial, there is no pressure for them to sign the paper, give us the consent immediately. Many patients are reluctant. They're in the office for the first, maybe second time, they're alone, we present the clinical trial, we go through it as best we can with them during that period of time. Sometimes people get confused when you give them a lot of information, particularly if you start using medical jargon. What we will do is tell the patient to take the form home, read it with whoever they need to read it with and explain it to that person, have that person call and ask questions of the clinical nurse, the doctor. Perhaps come back and have another discussion. There's no pressure to enroll in a clinical trial. It's offered, questions are answered, and it's encouraged, but patients do not need to participate if they do not want to after they've thought about it.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Will I be made a "Guinea pig?"</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">You will not be taken advantage of. Researchers do everything they can to keep you safe and informed. Unfortunately, this was not always the case. Many people have heard of the Tuskegee study and worry that it could happen again. Nowadays, researchers must be sure that participants are informed and consent to all aspects of the study.

Dr. Bonaventura:
Many times when we discuss clinical trials with patients, they have many questions, and understandably so. The most common question that I hear is, or the most common comment that I hear is, "I don't want to be a guinea pig, I don't want to be tested." "I don't want to undergo any new technology that hasn't been proven," and that's when the discussion about the fact that technologies, treatments have been evaluated in the past either in patients, animals, cadaver models, whatever the technique was, and that it's already been tested and it is ready to be used in human beings. We also discuss the fact that many times, if you're talking about a new drug regimen, particularly in the management of breast cancer, you may see a change in the order of the drugs, you may see a change in the dosage of the drugs, you may see a change in the interval in which the drug is being given to the patient. So it's not.... everything is not brand new. There may be just a little tweak of the system to change things in hopes for the better.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Will the treatment affect my appetite?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">You should be able to eat your normal diet while you receive treatment on a clinical trial, although you may find that certain foods taste differently.  You may also find that your appetite decreases during treatment.  This varies with each patient.  Health professionals recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals in order to meet your nutritional needs.

Lettie:
I had nausea once. I only had nausea once. I had to throw up. Other than that I never had nausea, but I couldn't eat. Food tasted terrible. They told me to use plastic forks. It didn't make no difference. I'd get a taste for something, but when I got it I didn't want it. I'd take one bite and it was... nothing tasted right. And I used to love beer. I used to drink beer every day. I'd come home from work and I'd drink me a beer, but that didn't taste good even after the treatment. I still don't drink beer like I used to. Now I kind of miss that, but I don't have the taste for it like I used to.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why do people participate in clinical trials?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are many reasons people participate in clinical trials. Clinical trials can feel empowering, giving patients the chance to receive a promising new type of cancer treatment. Patients may also get closer attention from physicians and the research team. In addition, some people value the opportunity to help researchers study new ways to treat cancer.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why should I participate in a trial if the standard treatment is effective?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The standard treatments we have for cancer today benefit some patients, but these treatments are not always successful.  Cancer researchers are dedicated to finding better treatments and are striving for a cure, but they need the help of patients to do this.  In the past several years, new drugs and treatments have been developed that ease suffering and prolong lives.  These improvements in therapy are the result of patients participating in clinical trials.

Dr. Bonaventura:
If individuals did not participate in clinical trials, there would be no advancement to the science of medicine. We have to think about things like; we have to think about diseases like polio. If Jonas Salk hadn't done research into the polio virus, how it was transmitted, and then ultimately come up with the polio vaccine, we would have a significant incidence of polio still in this country, and we no longer have that problem. Another disease is smallpox. We no longer have smallpox in this country, and it does exist in third-world countries, but not in this country. From the standpoint of the management of breast cancer, had those physicians not thought about decreasing the amount of surgery and treating with radiation, women would still be undergoing radical mastectomies. These operations were disfiguring and now we know, were not really necessary.</Content>

<Content id="0">The goals of clinical trials vary.  Your oncologist will talk to you about the expectations for your type of cancer.  Patients who participate in clinical trials may experience a long-term remission.  If your cancer is of an advanced stage, the goal of the clinical trial, or any treatment, would likely be shrinkage of your tumor and control of the symptoms associated with cancer.</Content>

Each clinical trial has a unique set of eligibility criteria.  The "matching process" will involve laboratory studies as well as other medical information about you. Usually there is no age limit for adult participation as long as you fulfill the eligibility criteria.</Content>

A standard treatment is a treatment that has already been demonstrated to benefit patients.  A research treatment is a new treatment that is hoped to be better than the standard treatment, but requires more testing to prove this.  A trial that compares standard treatment with a research treatment is usually a Phase III trial.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a placebo?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A placebo is a drug containing no active ingredients, such as a sugar pill, that may be used in clinical trials to determine the effects of a research treatment. It is not ethical to give a cancer patient a placebo when there is a known effective treatment. You will be told if a placebo is being used in your trail.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What do Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III mean?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">After lengthy testing in laboratories, promising treatments are ready to be tested on people for the first time. This is called a Phase I clinical trial. In Phase I, researchers try to find how much of a drug can be safely given, and what the likely side effects are.

In a Phase II trial, researchers ask the question "Is this drug effective in treating cancer?" In Phase II, researchers determine how well the drug works against a specific type of cancer and continue to watch for side effects.

A Phase III trial compares a new effective treatment with the currently best available treatment - also known as "standard treatment". A Phase III trial is the only way to learn which of the treatments is better.</Content>

<Content id="0">In a Phase I trial, the starting dose of a medication is based upon laboratory studies. Usually, the dose starts low and then increases if the dose doesn't cause serious side effects. This process, called "dosage escalation," is done so that the most appropriate dose for patients can be determined.</Content>

<Content id="0">Genetic studies are different from clinical trials.  Because cancer may be passed down in families, studies of our genes may help us understand cancer.  Such genetic studies may also help predict the risk of developing cancer.  Some genetic studies evaluate specific genes in cancer tissue which may help investigators understand why certain drugs are effective.</Content>

<Content id="0">The first time around my doctor offered me a clinical trial, and I was really just too frightened and too freaked out by the whole situation to read all the information about the clinical trial.  And, I regretted that.  I thought that it really limited my treatment options; and, because I wouldn't read the material.  So, I always thought to myself, if I had a recurrence, I would definitely, seriously consider a clinical trial.  And, so when I did have the recurrence, my doctor said, I have a clinical trial that I think would be very helpful to you.</Content>

<Content id="0">When I first met my oncologist I really didn't think I was going to get x-chemotherapy because of the size of the lump and what my surgeon said. So when I first met my oncologist he told me I was going to get chemotherapy.  I cried so bad that he told me, Okay, you go home and I'll see you in a week so you can calm down.  I guess I scared him so bad that he didn't know whether to finish talking to me or what.  When I came back the next week he explained everything that was going to take place and he offered me a clinical trial research.

They wanted to monitor women with breast cancer that was diagnosed with negative nodes. Every time I would go see my oncologist when I was in the clinical trial, I would get a full examination, I would get my blood work taken, I would spend time with my oncologist, he would make sure only blood work came back good, nothing was wrong, and I would go get my chemotherapy, and if he seen any problems he would address it quickly. I felt very comfortable.

The study last from September of 2005 to January of 2006, but I'm still in a study and I guess it's going to go for the next four or five years. They're still going to keep track of me. I go every couple of months to get blood work taken, to see my oncologist, to get a physical exam. At this time I come to the clinic every six months to get my blood work taken, to see my oncologist, to talk to him to see if anything has changed.</Content>

<Content id="0">I heard about the clinical trial when I was in the hospital.  I had broken my hip and that was how they actually found the cancer.  And I had someone talk to me and give me options, and one of them was the clinical trial.

Well it's one study, but there's two different studies within the group.  And then you just do a flip of the coin, and I got the two drugs as opposed to the other two drugs that they're doing.  So it's one study, but it's two different; it is two different studies technically I guess.

As far as right now, because they're going to keep doing it until something changes, so my clinical study is just going to continue until either I do worse, where, I mean, you know, the tumors aren't decreasing. So, I just keep doing the same study.</Content>

And, then I would be administered the drugs, intravenously, and that usually lasted maybe an hour and a half, two hours.   And, then every three months, I would have some sort of a scan, just to make sure that things were going in the right direction, which was shrinking.</Content>

<Content id="0">So, I go on day one and I get two chemos that are IVs, and then a week later, on day eight, I get one chemo and then I get a week off, basically to get my body back; to rejuvenate myself after having all the chemos. So, that's my cycle, I go one week, one week, and off.

Yeah, I go every nine weeks. I get scans, either CT scans, PET scans.  Of course I'm sure it depends on what type of cancer you have, what type of scans you're going get.  In my case I get those type of scans and they do those every nine weeks.  And then they compare those, you know, with prior ones, to see what the results are.  Whether or not progress, no progress, anything changed or not changed.</Content>

That's what my cardiologist told me. And if she hadn't stayed on me, called that doctor and he called me, I probably wouldn't be here today.

I think I was watched very closely. They were on it, they were on it. Especially my clinical nurse, she was on it, and she would call me sometimes, "How are you feeling?" I mean, I don't have an appointment or anything, but I was complaining. I had a complaint and she would call me in-between, "How are you feeling, Do you have..." you know, asking me questions and stuff. She said, "I'm concerned about you."

<Content id="0">In both instances, I received excellent care.

And, because I was part of a research study, they were collecting information, you know, wanted to know how I felt, you know, based on the drugs, those sorts of things.  However, these people, the hospital personnel turned out to be wonderful in terms of their support, and, they were very kind, and they were very caring.

<Content id="0">I thought it was my best treatment option. I thought it was going to; I thought it was my best treatment option. And, probably my doctor.  He just, he felt that I would benefit from being in this trial, and because he's been my doctor for over six years, I know the reputation he has as a researcher, that he does, has done a number of clinical trials, I just thought that this would; that he knew what he was doing and that this would be a good thing for me.

So, well, the benefit to me is, if this drug works, I'm right there on the cutting edge, getting all the benefits of the drug therapy.  As well as, for other people, they'll have that information.  So it worked for this population of people, and you know, they; they've done very well, and so, it might ultimately be effective enough treatment that it becomes standard care, until something better comes along.</Content>

So, whether or not it does help somebody in the future, I really want it to help me first.  So, I'm more concerned about me.  But on the other hand, I'll do my good deed for society and you know, do the clinical study.

<Content id="0">Just, I was more, probably more concerned about restrictions, things I could or couldn't do.  There really is no down side to the clinical study as far as I'm concerned.  It's a;  it's going to help somebody in the long run, and its helping you currently, so I don't really see that there was any real reason not to do it.  So my concerns were pretty minimal.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Anne on her concerns going into the clinical trial.</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">I really didn't have any concerns about participating in the clinical trial, the second time around.  The first time around it wasn't so much that I was afraid that I was just going to be treated as a research subject.  It was more that, the whole idea of being treated for cancer and having to choose, because I had options; having to choose and not being very educated in this area.  That bothered me.  But the second time around, you know, I just had a little bit more information.  And I just knew a lot more about the benefits of a clinical trial.  The benefit, the largest benefit being for myself, but also the benefit that it would ultimately be for others who came behind me.</Content>

<Content id="0">Big words, a lot of big words in the consent form.  Again, you're overwhelmed about your diagnosis, and then you get this consent form and you're reading it and you're thinking Oh I don't know what this word means.  So if you have someone to; again, your clinical study nurse, or a spouse or someone to read it with you, to ask questions. Once you get that information cleared up, what the big words mean, it's really not, I mean the overall package, was very easy to read.  But there's a lot of information in there and I read mine over and over and over again.  But it was, you need to do some type of research on it.</Content>

<Content id="0">I didn't have a lot of expectations about what the trial; how the trial would be going into it.  But I was surprised at how closely I was monitored.  And, every time I went in for a visit, one of the nurse coordinators always came around to the chemo chair to see how I was doing, and we'd usually spend half an hour talking.  And maybe it would be 10 or 15 minutes talking about how am I feeling, those sorts of things.  Talking about my blood results, the results from my blood test, and then the other 20 minutes was just talking about everyday life and what was going on with their family and what was going on in my life.  And so, probably the one thing that I, while I didn't have an expectation of this, one of the pleasant surprises was that these people became; you know, these people became part of my support group and they became friends.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Did Anne ever feel like a Guinea pig during the clinical trial?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">I didn't know a lot about clinical trials before my first diagnosis.  And, I probably had in my head just about all the myths that you can imagine that go along; that people are trying to break down now about clinical trials. So, the whole myth about being a guinea pig, and; to some degree, you are a research experiment.   I mean, you go into this and people are studying how you respond to a certain protocol.  But it's much bigger than just being a research experiment.  They're trying to provide you with the best therapy possible, and the best care possible.

I was treated very well.  I was treated with a lot of respect.  And I was treated with kindness, and a lot of compassion.  They see a lot of; they see a number of patients every day, and people are very, very fearful, and they are very skilled in making people, making a very anxious time less anxious.</Content>

<Content id="0">I felt that way. I felt like, when I first started looking at the thing, I thought I was, they'd use me as a guinea pig. I said, "I ain't, I don't want to be..." But then my daughter-in-law kept saying, "But they're going to watch you." Because she told me her sister works with these different studies and stuff and she had talked to her and she told her, "They'll really watch her. They will really watch her with that." I felt like we were being used in a certain way with the studies, but I had the option. I didn't have to take it. So if they used me as a guinea pig, it's my, me who done that not the doctors per say because I didn't have to sign that consent form.</Content>

No he talks to me like a regular person, because I told him, don't use big words.  No he's; I have a very good relationship with my doctor so, I can't you know; I may have a different type of relationship than other type of people.  I joke around with my doctor.

<Content id="0">Oh yes, they were very open to all of my concerns.  I did have some concerns.  One of the concerns was, sometime my white blood cell count was too low to get a treatment, and because of the clinical trial protocol, if you drop below a certain number, they generally don't like to treat you.  And, that bothered me a little bit. But in talking with my doctor, he always would go back to the pharmaceutical company who was also participating in the trial, and generally speaking, even if it was for that day, a reduced dose, I always got a treatment.  And that made me feel a lot better.  Because, I never wanted to go to the hospital and not be treated.</Content>

And, so I would take Tylenol and I would drink some sort of like a Gatorade type drink, and that helped quite a bit.  But I was very fortunate.

I get the flu like symptoms, fatigue, because of my type of cancer I have bone issues, so I get very achy, tired is probably my main; I do not get sick, no vomiting, because I do get pre-meds before the chemo, so that eliminates any type of nausea.  And I do have a prescription for that also, but I don't actually get sick to my stomach.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Can Shannon quit the clinical trial?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">That's one of the things that's made very clear in the beginning.  You can quit the study any time, by your own choice, because you just can't stand the side effects, or a doctor can pull you out if they think the study is not helping you personally.  You're the main priority, so if the study is not helping you, they're not going to keep you in it just for the sake of the study.  So if it's not helping you, they can pull you out of it and they will just do an alternative type of treatment.  So the feeling that you're stuck in it, is just not there.  You can just quit anytime you want.</Content>

But, if it ever got to the point where, where, you know. It was pretty clear, from talking with my oncologist at the beginning of the trial, that if this trial didn't work well for me, that we would make the decision together about whether to quit or not.

<Content id="0">If I knew someone that was diagnosed with cancer and they were offered the opportunity to participate in a clinical trial research I would encourage them to participate.

What I think we gain with people participating in clinical trial research is the doctors, the medical field getting the information they need to help us as citizens or people with cancer, better treat us, better diagnosis.

If someone asked me my opinion about being in a clinical trial research, I would encourage them to join the research. Why would I encourage them? My personal opinion is that think you'll be treated better. They'll look at you closer. They'll watch your blood work, how you reacting to the treatments, and they'll get some information that they need too but I think it's a benefit to you to join the clinical trial research.</Content>

I guess,  what I would just, what I would reiterate is, clinical trials are another treatment option, and they often provide you with the latest and the greatest therapies that are being looked at.  And they can provide a lot of benefit, and so they're definitely something worth exploring.</Content>

<Content id="0">Well, you already have cancer, it's a done deal.  It can't get any worse, period.  So you got to have choices, and if you have the choice of a clinical trial, then what's it going to do?  It can't hurt you, as long as you're well informed and you understand what you're getting into, it can't hurt you, you've already got cancer.  You should, at that point it's getting better and helping other people.  And if you can do both at the same time, I think that's a pretty good deal.

There's,  I mean, I just think the clinical study is just the perfect opportunity to you know, help yourself, and to help medical science.  I mean, its, there's no real reason not to do it.  I don't know why you wouldn't do it.  I'm sure there is.   I'm sure that somebody has come up with a reason not to do it, or there would be more people doing it probably. But I couldn't come up with a reason not to do it.  It's helping me personally, you know, currently I'm involved in it, and it's helping me so, I would suggest it to anybody.</Content>

They'll see a patient with a problem, and wonder is there a drug that can be used to help this person, to change their lifespan, to make it longer? Is there a drug, or a technique that can be used to give them a better quality of life for the amount of time that we  know they're going to have living with this disease? And it's just there,  it's just the doctors, PhDs, who develop various technologies, who have an intellectual curiosity about changing the issues that human beings have to deal with.</Content>

They're in the office for the first, maybe second time, they're alone, we present the clinical trial, we go through it as best we can with them during that period of time. Sometimes people get confused when you give them a lot of information, particularly if you start using medical jargon. What we will do is tell the patient to take the form home, read it with whoever they need to read it with and explain it to that person, have that person call and ask questions of the clinical nurse, the doctor. Perhaps come back and have another discussion. There's no pressure to enroll in a clinical trial. It's offered, questions are answered, and it's encouraged, but patients do not need to participate if they do not want to after they've thought about it.</Content>

"I don't want to undergo any new technology that hasn't been proven," and that's when the discussion about the fact that technologies, treatments have been evaluated in the past either in patients, animals, cadaver models, whatever the technique was, and that it's already been tested and it is ready to be used in human beings. We also discuss the fact that many times, if you're talking about a new drug regimen, particularly in the management of breast cancer, you may see a change in the order of the drugs, you may see a change in the dosage of the drugs, you may see a change in the interval in which the drug is being given to the patient. So it's not.... everything is not brand new. There may be just a little tweak of the system to change things in hopes for the better.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why is this research important?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">If individuals did not participate in clinical trials, there would be no advancement to the science of medicine. We have to think about things like,  we have to think about diseases like polio. If Jonas Salk hadn't done research into the polio virus, how it transmitted, and then ultimately come up with the polio vaccine, we would have a significant incidence of polio still in this country, and we no longer have that problem. Another disease is smallpox. We no longer have smallpox in this country, and it does exist in third-world countries, but not in this country. From the standpoint of the management of breast cancer, had those physicians not thought about decreasing the amount of surgery and treating with radiation, women would still be undergoing radical mastectomies. These operations were disfiguring and now we know, were not really necessary.</Content>

<Content id="0">As far as I'm concerned, there is no downside in participating in clinical trials. The studies, the clinical trials that are ready for "prime time" as we might call it, have been evaluated in animal models perhaps, in phase one trials. These drugs or treatments have already been tested and are ready to be used in large populations of patients, and I always recommend clinical trials to patients because, again, there are future generations that we need to think about, and as far as I'm concerned, there are no down...there is no downside to enrolling in a clinical trial.</Content>

<Content id="0">I can honestly say to you that if I had a disease, process, or a new diagnosis with new technologies on the horizon, I would seriously consider enrolling in a clinical trial.

I would not hesitate to do that because, again, knowing the history, just of one disease, and by that I mean breast cancer, in my lifetime, the changes have been dramatic. The technologies have changed dramatically, and the treatments have changed dramatically, and because of that, I feel it is important to enroll in clinical trials, and I would definitely enroll in a clinical trial.</Content>

<Content id="0">Part of the reason that I am involved in clinical trials is I am a university-based physician, and my practice is specific to patients with one disease process. When I see patients over and over again with the same disease, it makes me stop and think why is this happening? Is there something we can do to change it? Is there something we can do to decrease the problems and the issues that this patient is having? And it just forces you to, it forces me to think that there's got to be a better way, or an easier way for both the physician and the patient to be treated and to be taken care of.</Content>

<Content id="0">I think many times we hear about the bad things that happen in clinical trials. Many times I'll have patients come to my office, and they tell me about their neighbor's infection, or their neighbor's complication when they had the same procedure done and asked me why I'm not doing a certain X-ray when their neighbor had that X-ray, and it's the same sort of thing we tend to hear a lot about when things don't go perfectly - when everything isn't 100%. What we don't hear about are the trials that have been done, and have had excellent results. In the field of medicine, it's rare that anything is 100 percent. There are always possible complications. There are always possible side effects. And I think, as clinical investigators, and as patients enrolling in clinical trials, we need to understand that. But, we also need to understand that in the long run, that for a small amount of discomfort, or possible small or insignificant side effects, we can gain a lot of important information. And again, I really think the most important thing is no one ever tells you about the clinical trials that have been done with excellent results. And you only hear about the trials that, as the Vioxx situation presented where there were significant complications, deaths, et cetera.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What was your clinical trial about?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">They were looking at the efficacy of two different drug combinations.  One was Taxotere and Capecitabine and the second was Taxotere and Gemzar.  And this was a cross-over clinical trial. So, the idea behind the crossover clinical trial was, you would be randomized into one drug regiment, and, after 3 or 4 months, you would be tested, and if that drug protocol didn't seem to be working for you, you would be transferred over to the other drug.  So, it wasn't like you would be without options.  And, that was one of the things that I liked about this clinical trial.  And, so I read the information and I went through the whole process,  in terms of talking with the nurse coordinator, talking with the doctor, reading as much information as I could, and I actually very quickly, within a couple of days, decided that this clinical trial was good for me.</Content>

<Content id="0">Lymph nodes are small glands found throughout the body,  they are part of the body's immune system.  The lymph nodes in the armpit are the ones closest to the breast.  If your lymph nodes are positive, it means that cancer cells have traveled from the original breast tumor to the nearby lymph nodes.  This suggests that there is risk that tumor cells may have spread to other parts of your body.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What does Her-2 neu status reveal about my breast cancer?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Her-2 neu is a name for an important growth factor receptor.  This is a gene within cells that determines how they grow, divide and repair themselves.  Normally it is present in all cells. However, in 20 to 30% of breast cancers, there are too many copies of this gene within the breast cancer cell.  Having too many copies means that your tumor will be called Her-2-positive.The result of this is that the breast cancer cell may grow faster and may be more likely to spread to other parts of the body.  Breast cancer with this increased level of the Her-2 neu gene is also called a Her-2 neu overexpressing tumor.  There is a treatment that is chosen specifically for Her-2 neu overexpressing tumors. The drug used in this treatment is called, Herceptin or trastuzumab.   If a normal number of copies of this gene is found, your tumor will be called Her-2 negative.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the stages of breast cancer?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">In order to treat breast cancer, doctors need to know the stage of the cancer.  This is determined by the size of the cancer, whether lymph nodes are positive or negative and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The process of determining whether cancer cells have spread is called staging.  Although it is good news if the staging tests do not reveal any spread of cancer, it is still possible that a few undetected breast cancer cells may have spread throughout the body. Staging is done through a variety of tests such as chest x-rays, blood work, and bone scans. Doctors use special language to communicate the information gathered from staging tests. In general terms, Stage . means that cancer cells were found in the breast, but were not found outside of the breast.  Stage I. means that cancer cells have been found in the breast and in at least one of the lymph nodes in the armpit. Stage II. is used to describe a cancer where the breast tumor itself is large and often has positive armpit lymph nodes, or that the breast tumor has attached to parts of the chest wall. Inflammatory breast cancer is also considered Stage II.. Stage I. means that the breast cancer has spread to distant sites of the body such as bone, lungs or liver.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What does ER or PR positive tell the doctor in terms of my treatment?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The tissue from your tumor can be tested for specific characteristics about your breast cancer.  Some tests look for receptors for hormones. Hormones influence the growth and development of tissues, such as the breast, that have receptors.  Two important hormones in breast cancer are estrogen and progesterone.  If your breast cancer cells have receptors for estrogen, it is called ER positive.  If your tumor is found to be ER positive, treatment strategies to keep cancer cells from growing may block the estrogen receptors or decrease the amount of estrogen in your body.  There are different drugs to treat ER positive breast cancers depending upon your menopausal status. For example, Tamoxifen is one of the drugs used in premenopausal women to block the estrogen receptor. Arimidex is an example of a drug used in postmenopausal women that decreases the amount of estrogen in the body. Breast cancer cells that don't have detectable estrogen receptors are called ER negative cells.

If your breast cancer cells have receptors for progesterone, it is called PR positive.  ER positive and PR positive tumors are treated in the same manner.  Breast cancer cells that don't have detectable progesterone receptors are called PR negative cells.  If your hormone receptors are negative, you do not require hormonal treatment approaches for your breast cancer.</Content>

This test may be performed on breast cancer tissue from women who are typically node negative. This test measures the level of important genes that determine the likelihood of the cancer to spread and the potential benefits of hormonal therapy or chemotherapy.</Content>

<Content id="0">There are several different types of surgery that are performed for breast cancer.  Today, the most common surgery is a lumpectomy.  A lumpectomy is a breast-conserving surgery where the tumor and some surrounding normal tissue are removed leaving the majority of the breast intact.  A mastectomy is a type of breast surgery where the entire breast is removed.  Lymph nodes may be sampled with a limited procedure called a sentinel node biopsy.  Sometimes a more complete removal of many lymph nodes in the armpit is advised using a procedure called an axillary dissection.   The surgical approaches that are available today are a direct result of women participating in previous cancer clinical trials.</Content>

<Content id="0">Neoadjuvant therapy is a treatment given before an operation is done to remove the breast tumor.  This approach is considered when shrinking the tumor prior to surgery may allow a less deforming or less invasive procedure to be done.   For example, this may mean performing a lumpectomy instead of a mastectomy, or a sentinel node biopsy instead of an axillary dissection.  Therefore, treatment before surgery may be desirable not only to preserve as much of the breast and lymph nodes as possible, but also to improve surgical recovery.  The most common form of neoadjuvant therapy is chemotherapy.  The neoadjuvant therapies that are available today are a direct result of women participating in previous cancer clinical trials.</Content>

<Content id="0">Adjuvant Therapy is treatment given after surgery to some patients where there is a chance that microscopic cancer cells may have spread.  The goal of adjuvant therapy is to treat microscopic disease in order to reduce the risk of future recurrence.  Research has allowed physicians to better predict which patients are more likely to benefit from receiving adjuvant therapy.  Some of the factors that your physician will include in this decision are the size of your tumor, the number of lymph nodes involved, the ER and PR receptor status, and the Her-2 neu status.  Hormonal treatments and chemotherapy are examples of adjuvant therapies. The adjuvant therapies that are available today are a direct result of women participating in previous cancer clinical trials.</Content>

<Content id="0">Chemotherapy refers to drugs that kill cancer cells.  Several drugs are often given at the same time and can reach cancer cells throughout the body.  Chemotherapy drugs work in several different ways to destroy cancer cells.   These include disrupting cancer cells by reducing tumor blood flow and turning off the internal chemical signals that promote growth.  Chemotherapy drugs are given over a span of many weeks.  Side effects are experienced when these drugs affect normal tissues as well.  Frequent side effects of chemotherapy include decreased white blood counts with risk of infection, nausea and sometimes vomiting and hair loss.  Some names of common chemotherapy drugs include: Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide, Docetaxel, and Paclitaxel.  Your doctor may refer to these drugs by their brand name.  For example, Doxorubicin is also known as Adriamycin.</Content>

<Content id="0">Radiation is used after surgery to treat cancer cells that may be in the breast, chest wall or nearby lymph nodes.  Even after the surgeon has removed the visible tumor, there may still be microscopic cancer cells in nearby tissue. These leftover cells can be killed by radiation.  Radiation, like an X-ray, is most often administered from an external beam. This beam is directed carefully to avoid injury to other areas such as the heart or lungs.  Each treatment takes only a few minutes but 25 to 30 treatments are required.  Radiation damages cell DNA and this destroys cancer cells because intact DNA is necessary for cell survival.  The most frequent side effects of radiation include local skin irritation like a sunburn, and sometimes increased fatigue.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How have past clinical trials significantly changed breast cancer surgery and treatment?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical trials have changed the way breast cancer is treated completely from the way it was treated over 50 years ago. Fifty years ago, women used to have a radical mastectomy, that is, their entire breast, the underlying chest wall, the lymph nodes were removed. There were terrible problems with lymphedema, which is a swelling of the arm and the chest wall, as well as terrible cosmetic problems.  Fifty years of clinical trials have proven that we can do less surgery on women, much less disfiguring surgery. Most women now have a lumpectomy, and what's called a sentinel lymph node dissection, which is far less severe and cosmetically damaging. We have a good idea of which women will require chemotherapy to help prevent their cancer from coming back. We also have a much better idea of which women require hormonal therapy or anti-hormonal therapy, like Tamoxifen and drugs like Arimidex (anastrozole). We actually have a very good idea of who to treat,  who will benefit from all of this. And in fact, the survival of women because of clinical trials has improved about 30 percent to 40 percent in the last 25 to 30 years.</Content>

<Content id="0">A sentinel lymph node biopsy is a surgical procedure to determine whether cancer cells have spread to the lymph nodes under your arm.  With this procedure, a substance is injected near the breast tumor. This substance may be radioactive or it may be a dye.   The radioactive substance or dye flows through the lymphatic ducts to the lymph nodes. The first node to receive the substance or dye is removed and examined by the pathologist.  If no cancer cells are found, further surgery on the lymph nodes is not recommended.  A sentinel lymph node biopsy is done to spare patients from having to undergo the more extensive axillary dissection.  However, if cancer cells are found in the sentinel lymph node, most often more lymph nodes will be removed during an axillary dissection.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How do doctors describe tumors?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Staging and grading are used to describe tumors.  Stage is the extent of the disease using uniform terms. TNM is a common classification system. T stands for tumor size. When the numbers 1 through 4 follow the letter T, higher numbers mean larger tumors. N stands for Nodes, that is, the number and location of lymph nodes that have cancer cells. When the numbers 0 through 3 follow the letter N, higher numbers mean more lymph nodes that contain cancer. M stands for metastases.  If 0 is after M it means no metastases have been found, while 1 after M means that the cancer has spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes to other parts of the body.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How is participating in a clinical trial different from getting standard treatment?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Patients who participate in clinical trials undergo a similar experience as those in standard care.  In both cases, patients receive treatment for their cancer.  Cancer treatments today involve therapies that may cause side effects. All patients being treated for cancer receive close observation.  However, there are some key differences between clinical trials and standard treatment.  Patients in a clinical trial are required to review and sign a lengthy and detailed research consent form.  In addition, there may be side effects that are unanticipated on the clinical trial.  For this reason, patients on clinical trials may be monitored more frequently and are sometimes required to come in to the clinic more often.  They may undergo more frequent testing than patients on standard therapy.  In either case, patients generally report that they receive excellent care whether they are on a clinical trial or receiving standard treatment.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Can you explain the difference between adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Adjuvant therapy is therapy after you've had primary surgery to remove your cancer. For example, you've had a lumpectomy or a mastectomy, you've had a lymph node dissection, and your cancer essentially is gone. What adjuvant therapy tries to do is to kill off any little bits of cancer that may be somewhere else in your body that we can't see. That's called adjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy, on the other hand, is systemic therapy, be it chemotherapy or anti-hormonal therapy, before surgery. The goals of neoadjuvant therapy are to try to shrink the cancer before we do surgery.  If you came in with a really large breast cancer, the size of a tennis ball in your breast, (thankfully, I see that not as often in people as I used to) we would want to shrink your cancer down with chemotherapy before surgery. We also do neoadjuvant chemotherapy to try to see if the chemo works. That's why it's a very good time for us to try new things, because what we do is we test a neoadjuvant therapy, how many people respond to the cancer, and how many people have their cancer go away completely.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the advantages and disadvantages of adjuvant therapy?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The major advantage of adjuvant therapy is that it is systemic, so it kills off any cancer cells. The idea is to kill off any cancer cells that are anywhere in your body that we can't see. Because, when you come in after having had breast cancer, a question people ask all the time is, How do you know it's nowhere else in my body. Well, we would either do an x-ray or a CAT-scan, maybe a bone scan to be sure it's not in your bones.  If it's nowhere else, there still might be little microscopic bits of it somewhere else in your body, and you need the therapy that goes all throughout your body to be sure that there's no cancer cells left, that they're all killed. The idea behind adjuvant therapy is that it kills off all of the little microscopic bits of cancer that we can't see. The disadvantage, if any, of adjuvant therapy is like that of any therapy, it might have toxicity. With chemotherapy your hair will more than likely fall out, nine times out of ten. Chemotherapy sometimes suppresses the white cells of your blood, makes you a little bit more prone to infection temporarily. Those are the disadvantages of any adjuvant therapy that we may use.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why would you recommend adjuvant therapy to one of your patients?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">I would recommend adjuvant therapy to one of my patients because I know that if she goes through, 4 months of chemotherapy, or 6 months of chemotherapy, or 5 years of an anti-hormonal therapy like Tamoxifen, her chance of the cancer coming back will go down dramatically. And because of adjuvant therapy now, we can tell most women that they have an 85 to 90 percent chance that their cancer will never come back. That's what I tell women now. It's great. It's just a matter of what you have to go through, whether you have to go through anti-hormonal therapy like Tamoxifen, if you have to go through Tamoxifen plus chemotherapy, or something else like that. That's really why I give women adjuvant therapy.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What can patients expect if they receive adjuvant treatment?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Patients can expect a number of things depending on the adjuvant treatment. If it's chemotherapy, generally it's anywhere from 4 to 8 doses of chemotherapy, usually given every 3 weeks, although sometimes we give it every 2 weeks,   sometimes, we give it weekly. It really depends on the kind of chemotherapy they get. With the modern chemotherapies for breast cancer at least, it's likely that you're going to lose your hair. And believe me, we've tried everything from ice packs on people's heads to running around the clinic to try to prevent them from their hair falling out, but it's likely your hair will fall out. It's also likely with chemotherapy that it will suppress the white cells in your blood, making you a little bit more prone to infection. If a chemotherapy cycle, that is, the number of days between chemotherapy is 3 weeks, usually your white cells are at their lowest about 10 days after you start, and that's when you're most prone to infection. It doesn't mean you can't go out and do all the things you normally do.  It just means that if you're not feeling well, we ask you to take your temperature, and if it's above 100 or 101, call your doctor, and we check your white cells to see if they're too low.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">If a patient said no to adjuvant therapy, what would her options be?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Generally, if a patient says no to adjuvant therapy that's her decision. What I try to do when people come to me is to lay out for them all of the choices that they have. Generally, if a woman comes in to me and has positive lymph nodes with cancer that are involved under her arm, and she is fairly young, and her cancer does not express the receptor for estrogen. In that particular woman, she would get probably a substantial benefit from chemotherapy. But if she doesn't want to do that, that's her choice. Your chances of it never coming back in ten years are 90 percent with chemotherapy, 60 or 70 percent without, and that's a 20-30 percent benefit. That's your choice if you want to do it. I'm still going to treat you the same way,  you can still come to the clinic every four to six months for the first several years, and every 6 months for a couple years after that. We'll still do mammograms on you once a year, or in some cases, MRI scans of your breasts once a year. But, if you don't want to do chemotherapy, your risk of reoccurrence is higher. And if someone says, Look, I don't want to do it. That's okay. I mean, it's a little bit more difficult when you're older, and when the side effects of chemotherapy maybe are a little bit worse.  In that case, if the benefit is only 2 or 3 percent, some women, from chemotherapy or any adjuvant therapy, some women say, Look, I don't want to do it for 2 or 3 percent. Everybody has a different feeling about what that percentage is so that's why I view it as my role as an oncologist to say, Look, these are your options. This is the percentage chance that you have, if you do X, Y, or .. .And some women say yes and some women say no.</Content>

Some women really want a minimalist approach. They just want to take as minimum therapy as possible. Other women come in and say, I want everything possible. We take that into account. We also take into account the overall health of a woman, what we call her performance status, or her ability to tolerate therapy.

If a woman has had a mastectomy, and had a primary cancer greater than 5 centimeters, she'll need radiation to the wall of her chest. If a woman has more than 4 lymph nodes involved, she'll need radiation to the wall of her chest. Generally, most women, who have estrogen receptor positive breast cancers, are women who would need some sort of anti-hormonal therapy.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Should patients consider a double mastectomy?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Mastectomy or not, and especially double mastectomy, is a very individualized decision. There are certain women, again, our role is to A) say what the risk of local reoccurrence is in a woman's breast after having a lumpectomy, and B) what's the risk of cancer in the other breast if she doesn't do anything. With newer techniques like MRI scans, we can tell whether there's cancer in the other breast many years, probably before it comes clinically apparent. It's really a women's choice. I've had women who say, I don't want to lose my breasts. I've had women who have had a cancer or sometimes a reoccurring cancer in the same breast that have said, I just don't want to deal with this anymore. or I prefer to have a bilateral mastectomy., and in some cases not have a reconstruction. Some cases have a reconstruction, have new breasts. It's really a very personal decision. Again, we try to do, and what most of the people at Magee's Breast Cancer Center try to do, is really work with a woman to try to figure out what she really wants at the end of the day and try to help her make that decision. But in the end of the day, it's her decision.</Content>

<Content id="0">Cancer is not just one disease but many diseases.    Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. Normally, your body forms new cells as you need them, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor.  There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Most cancers are named for the organ or type of cell in which they start - for example, cancer that begins in the colon is called colon cancer.  When a cancer that starts in one place spreads to another, it's called metastases. This site discusses clinical trials that are designed to find improved treatments breast for cancer.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the risks involved in participation?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Most cancer treatments have risks or side effects of varying degrees, whether they are used in standard care or in a clinical trial.  Many of these can be prevented or minimized.  All patients are monitored carefully.  The consent form for a research study documents known risks and side effects.  Ask your doctor or research nurse about specific side effects or risks associated with your treatment.</Content>

<Content id="0">You always have the right to decide if you will stay in the trial.  But when you sign up for a clinical trial, the day-to-day decisions about your treatment are determined by the protocol.  It's important that you follow the schedule precisely.  If you're not able to fulfill the protocol requirements, a clinical trial may not be the best option for you.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Can I stop participating in the trial?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">You can decide to withdraw your participation in a clinical trial at any time.  This will not jeopardize your future care by your physician or at the institute where you receive your care.  Never, ever feel trapped in a clinical trial; there are lots of reasons why you might decide to withdraw.  If you decide that you can't continue, make sure to tell the doctor or nurse your reasons for leaving.  It will help with future studies.

Dr. Bonaventura:
When a patient is enrolled in a clinical trial, the option always exists to leave, and the option's available at any point during that trial. If they become frightened, if they have side effects, and they become concerned that the side effects are seriously out of the norm, when compared to someone who is not in the trial, they can always leave the trial, and return to the standard treatment which is available today.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What's the next step if I agree to participate?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Once you decide to participate in a trial, you will be asked to sign a consent form.  Treatment will usually begin within a few days after the consent has been signed.  However, it may be necessary to have additional testing performed related to your participation before treatment begins.

[Dr. Bonaventura]
When I think a patient is a candidate for a clinical trial, what I normally do is explain the trial to them, and explain the rationale for the trial. Then what we do is we sit, we go through the consent form, and we go through what exactly the patient will have to deal with when she or he becomes involved in this trial. Is blood work going to be drawn? Are X-Rays going to be taken? Will measurements be taken? Whatever the trial involves, we go through that. The goal is to prepare the patient for exactly what will happen to him or her.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Who can help me decide what's best for me?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">If you are trying to decide about joining a clinical trial, there are many places to go for help.  The research team of a particular trial will tell you all about the treatment being tested.  They can tell you anything you want to know; such as risks and benefits, and the steps of the clinical trial.  Your family doctor may be able to give you further advice.  And don't forget your friends, family, and support network.  Those closest to you can be there to listen as you work through your own concerns.  At the end of the day, the decision is yours.  But, you are not in this alone.  Rely on those around you to help.

Anne:
I did not seek any help with the consent form.  And, I also did not talk to my family about whether or not I should be in the clinical trial because I felt that this is my decision, and this is a decision between me and my oncologist.  And, I felt very firm about that.  And, I really did not want to get into a position where I had friends and family weighing in on what they thought I should do.

Barbara:
How I went about making a decision about entering the clinical trial was my family. My family, my mother and my sister, we talked about it. My sister and my mother accompanied me to each and every doctor's appointment, chemotherapy treatment, yes.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why did you participate in a clinical trial?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">[Anne]
I thought it was my best treatment option. I thought it was going to, I thought it was my best treatment option. And, probably my doctor.  He just, he felt that I would benefit from being in this trial, and because he's been my doctor for over six years, I know the reputation he has as a researcher, that he does, has done a number of clinical trials, I just thought that this would, that he knew what he was doing and that this would be a good thing for me.

So, well, the benefit to me is, if this drug works, I'm right there on the cutting edge, getting all the benefits of the drug therapy.  As well as, for other people, they'll have that information.  So it worked for this population of people, and you know, they; they've done very well, and so, it might ultimately be effective enough treatment that it becomes standard care, until something better comes along.

[Barbara]
Because me, as being an African-American woman, wanted them to have some research on African American women to help with the medication, the type of treatment that we, that they can give us to help us. Looking back on it, yes I believe it was the best thing for me to do. Would I do it again? Yes I would.

[Shannon]
Well, I would like to see that, you know, obviously you want to see a cure, but I would be more realistic in hoping that maybe the treatments that I'm receiving and the combination of drugs they're using on me, will benefit someone else with the same type of cancer that I have.  So, whether or not it does help somebody in the future, I really want it to help me first.  So, I'm more concerned about me.  But on the other hand, I'll do my good deed for society and you know, do the clinical study.  Which is why I participated in it; which is why I'm sitting here talking to you guys, against my better judgement

[Lettie]
My daughter-in-law, she, well I went home and I talked to my family about the trial, you know, what I should do, and my daughter-in-law, she said, "Well I think they'd follow you closer if you was on the trial." And like, when you say cancer, it's like a scary something anyway. You know, it's just something like, you don't expect to hear it happening to you. I talked about everything with my family, everything, from day one, from the day I was diagnosed. My family was there with me for every treatment, everything. Every time with the doctor there was a family member there with me. Whatever I had to do there was family there. She said, my daughter-in-law felt like, "Maybe you should give it a try." And I did.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Would you recommend a clinical trial to a friend?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Barbara:
If I knew someone that was diagnosed with cancer and they were offered the opportunity to participate in a clinical trial research I would encourage them to participate.

What I think we gain with people participating in clinical trial research is the doctors, the medical field getting the information they need to help us as citizens or people with cancer, better treat us, better diagnosis.

If someone asked me my opinion about being in a clinical trial research, I would encourage them to join the research. Why would I encourage them? My personal opinion is that think you'll be treated better. They'll look at you closer. They'll watch your blood work, how you reacting to the treatments, and they'll get some information that they need too but I think it's a benefit to you to join the clinical trial research.

Anne:
I would definitely recommend a clinical trial to,  This is what I would recommend,  if they are diagnosed with cancer, or any other kind of a disease, where they are eligible for a clinical trial, I would definitely recommend that they stay open to hearing everything about the trial, what the aims of the trial are, as well as also understanding what the current standard treatment is and what that will provide for them as well.

I guess,  what I would just, what I would reiterate is, clinical trials are another treatment option, and they often provide you with the latest and the greatest therapies that are being looked at.  And they can provide a lot of benefit, and so they're definitely something worth exploring.

Shannon:
Well, you already have cancer, it's a done deal.  It can't get any worse, period.  So you got to have choices, and if you have the choice of a clinical trial, then what's it going to do?  It can't hurt you, as long as you're well informed and you understand what you're getting into, it can't hurt you, you've already got cancer.  You should, at that point it's getting better and helping other people.  And if you can do both at the same time, I think that's a pretty good deal.

There's, I mean, I just think the clinical study is just the perfect opportunity to you know, help yourself, and to help medical science.  I mean, its, there's no real reason not to do it.  I don't know why you wouldn't do it.  I'm sure there is.   I'm sure that somebody has come up with a reason not to do it, or there would be more people doing it probably. But I couldn't come up with a reason not to do it.  It's helping me personally, you know, currently I'm involved in it, and it's helping me so, I would suggest it to anybody.

Lettie:
The only thing I can tell anybody about clinical trials is do your homework, think it over, and see whatever is the best thing for you. I wouldn't advise no one to just sign the papers. Think about what is best for you. Do you think this may help you? And being that my sister had breast cancer five years before I got breast cancer.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Who decides what clinical trials are available?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical trials come about because of the intellectual curiosity of physicians who see patients with problems. They'll see a patient with a problem, and wonder is there a drug that can be used to help this person, to change their lifespan, to make it longer? Is there a drug, or a technique that can be used to give them a better quality of life for the amount of time that we  know they're going to have living with this disease? And it's just there,  it's just the doctors, PhDs, who develop various technologies, who have an intellectual curiosity about changing the issues that human beings have to deal with.</Content>
