<BaseQuestion id="0">When should I tell my doctor about new symptoms after cancer treatment has ended?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">After your cancer treatment, you can expect to have some lingering side effects such as 

&#8226; Fatigue
&#8226; Memory and thinking problems
&#8226; Pain
&#8226; Tingling or numbness in your feet and hands
&#8226; Lymphedema
&#8226; Mouth or teeth problems
&#8226; Changes in weight or eating habits, 
&#8226; Trouble swallowing
&#8226; Bladder or bowel control problems 
&#8226; Problems with sexual function

It is important to talk openly with your healthcare providers about these issues. They can not only help you to relieve these side effects, but they can also help address concerns about whether these side effects signal the return of your cancer. For more information on these long-term side effects and how to manage them, look in the Resources Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Can I use complimentary medicine?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Complimentary or alternative medicine includes a variety of practices that are used in addition to the treatments that your doctor prescribes to treat your cancer. For instance, meditation, yoga, massage, and acupuncture may be used to help reduce pain, lower anxiety and improve mood. Things like aromatherapy, special diets, and vitamins or herbal supplements are also considered alternative medicine. 

If you are thinking about using any alternative medicine therapies during or after your cancer treatment, talk to your doctor first. Even if something is described as homeopathic, all natural, or organic, it can still interfere with your treatment or cause dangerous side effects. There is more information on alternative medicine in the Resources Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a CT Scan?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">CT Scans are commonly called "CAT Scans" The Letters CT stand for computed tomography. This type of scan uses x-rays and a computer to make a three-dimensional picture of the inside of your body. These pictures show where and how big a tumor is. 

CT scans themselves are painless. You will lie down on the table attached to the scanner, then the radiology technician will make the table move into a correct position for your scan. Sometimes a dye is used to make the picture clearer. This is called CT with contrast. The dye can be injected into your vein using a needle, or you may be given the dye in a pill that you will swallow. 

You may need to have more than one CT scan. Because each CT scan exposes you to X-rays, which are a form of radiation, doctors sometimes use a CT scan called LDCT, which stands for low-dose computed tomography. This type of CT scan uses lower doses of x-rays and so that you're not exposed to as much radiation.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are nodules or masses?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Nodules are small, unusual spots on the lungs that may or may not be cancer. Masses are unusual spots that are larger than 3 centimeters which is about the diameter of a quarter. 

Not all nodules or masses are lung cancer. About 60% are caused by other things, like infections, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or COPD, calcium build-up in the arteries leading to the heart, a weakened section of artery that bulges out, or cancer that has spread from other parts of the body to the lung. 

Nodules can also be benign, or non-cancerous tumors called hamartomas that do not grow and spread like cancer</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a surgical biopsy?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Surgical biopsy is the sampling of lung tissue through an incision in the chest. 

This type of biopsy is done in the hospital in an operating room. Like other surgeries, you will need to stop eating and drinking at least 8 hours before the surgery. You will be given general anesthesia through an IV so that you are fully asleep during surgery. Often during the procedure, the tissue that is removed is examined by the pathologist while you are still in surgery so that doctors can remove more tissue if necessary without another operation. 

There are different types of surgical biopsies. In a thoracoscopic biopsy, an endoscope, or thin hollow tube, is inserted through the incision in your chest. A camera and biopsy tools are inserted through the endoscope to allow the surgeon to examine and collect tissue for testing. This may also be called video-assisted thoracic surgery or VATS biopsy. Your doctor may also remove nodules or other tissue at the same time. 

In an open biopsy is your doctor makes an incision in the skin on your chest and removes a piece of lung tissue. Depending on what the pathologist sees when they look at the removed tissue under the microscope, your surgeon may do other procedures such as the removal of a lung lobe. These biopsies generally require at least an overnight hospital stay.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a biopsy?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A biopsy is a procedure that removes cells from the tumor so that the cells can be looked at under a microscope to determine if they are cancerous. 

There are different kinds of biopsies. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) uses a very thin, hollow needle attached to a syringe to take a small amount of fluid or very small pieces of tissue from the tumor. If you're having a fine needle aspiration, your skin will be numbed with a shot of local pain killer before the doctor makes a small cut and inserts the needle into the tumor. Sometimes doctors use a CT scan or ultrasound to guide the needle to the site of the tumor. 

Another type of biopsy is a core biopsy. Needles used in a core biopsy are slightly larger than those used in fine needle aspiration. A core biopsy removes a small piece of tissue. You will be given one or more shots of pain killer where the biopsy is being done to numb your skin. 

You can usually go home the same day after fine needle and core biopsies. Biopsies that cannot be done with a needle may be done surgically or through bronchoscopy.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How is surgery used to treat lung cancer?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Surgery may be done to confirm a cancer diagnosis, to determine the cancer stage, or to completely remove tumors in the early stages. In some cases, surgery can also be done to remove metastases. 

When a tumor is removed, the nearby lymph nodes and a small amount of normal tissue surrounding the tumor is taken as well. This border of healthy tissue is called the tumor margin. The tumor margin is examined by a pathologist to see if it contains any cancer cells. If there are no cancer cells in the tumor margin, it is most likely that all of the cancer has been removed. However, if there are cancer cells in the margin, it may mean that not all of the tumor was removed and you may need to have another surgery, or chemotherapy or radiation to remove or kill the remaining cancer cells. 

There is a myth that having surgery on a tumor allows the cancer to spread by breaking cancer cells off from the tumor. Surgery does not cause cancer to spread. There are many different types of surgeries that doctors do, depending on the size and location of the tumor. Look in the related questions area to your right to learn about different types of surgeries to remove cancer.</Content>

<Content id="0">After surgery or a biopsy, the cells that doctors remove will be looked at under a microscope by a pathologist to see if they are cancer cells. If the pathologist does find cancer cells, they will try to determine what type of cancer you have so that the oncologist will know what treatment to give you.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is staging?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">In addition to the main types of cancers and their subtypes, doctors also describe cancer in stages. 

Stages describe where the original tumor is located in the body, the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, and whether the cancer has spread to a different part of the body, or metastasized. This information helps your doctor plan the best treatment for you. 

Cancer is staged using the TNM method, which stands for Tumor, Nodes and Metastases. You may hear health care providers talk about cancer as stage one through four, and see stages written using roman numerals, like this and with the letters "A" and "B". For more information on staging, look in the Resource Area and the related questions on this page.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How is lung cancer staged?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Based on your physical exam, imaging tests like CT or PET scans and blood tests, your doctor will give you a "clinical stage" which estimates the extent of your cancer. 

Additional testing of lymph nodes after surgery can give your doctor a more precise idea of the extent of your cancer. This is called the "pathologic stage." 

The pathologic stage may be the same as the clinical stage, or it may show that your cancer has spread more than expected. The tests and procedures that doctors use to tell what stage your cancer is will depend on the cancer site and your health.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What should I know about getting treatment for cancer?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Getting treatment for cancer can place many unexpected demands on your time and energy and those of your caregivers as well, so it's important to prepare by getting as much information as possible about how your treatment may affect your life. 

When you talk to your doctor about treatment options, make sure you find out how often and for how long you will need to go into the treatment center, and what kinds of tests you will need and how often. Before you start treatment, you may want to check with your employer to find out what sick leave you are eligible for. Your treatment schedule and side effects from treatment may affect whether or not you are able to continue to work during treatment. 

You may find that you need help with transportation, keeping track of medications, appointments and all the paperwork that comes with a cancer diagnosis. Look in the related questions area for tips on how to manage these important details while you're receiving treatment.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How is lung cancer treated?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Your doctor will recommend treatment for your cancer based on what type of cancer you have, where it is located, whether or where it has spread, and what genetic markers it has, as well as your general health and any other conditions you may have. 

Lung cancer may be treated with chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and supportive care, or a combination of these therapies.

Keep in mind that all forms and stages of cancer can be treated, but the goals of treatment may be different depending on the type of cancer you have and what stage it is. Treatments for some early stage cancers aim to cure the cancer, meaning that the person could hope to be cancer free after treatment is complete. 

For patients with later stage cancers, sometimes the best goal of treatment may be to extend life or reduce symptoms and side effects rather than trying to cure the patient's cancer.  In these stages, supportive care has been shown to increase quality of life as well as extending life when compared to treatment with more aggressive options such as chemotherapy or radiation.  

In deciding what treatment is best for your type of cancer, your oncologist will follow treatment guidelines agreed on by national cancer experts.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is immunotherapy?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Immunotherapy describes treatments that help your immune system fight your cancer. Immunotherapy is also called biologic therapy or biotherapy. 

Your immune system helps keep you healthy by recognizing and destroying cells that can make you sick, like viruses and germs. Cancer cells are sometimes overlooked by the immune system because they are made by your body, so they are not seen as "foreign." 

One type of immunotherapy, called monoclonal antibodies, works by marking cancer cells for destruction by your immune system. Another type of immunotherapy, called immune checkpoint inhibitors boost your immune system, allowing it to go all out in destroying suspicious cells that it might not normally attack. There are other immunotherapy drugs, called non-specific immunotherapies, that make your immune system stronger and better able to fight cancer cells.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is chemotherapy?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Chemotherapy medications work by stopping the cancer cells from growing and dividing. Chemotherapy may be given by an intravenous or IV tube and needle, called an infusion. Some chemotherapy medications are given as an injection like a shot or can be taken in pill form. You may take one chemotherapy medication, or a combination of medications depending on your cancer and what stage it is. 

The side effects of chemotherapy depend on the individual, the type of medication and the dose your doctor has prescribed you. They can include fatigue, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, hair loss, low blood counts, mouth sores and an increased risk of infection. 

I encourage you to talk to your doctor or nurse before starting your treatment, so you know what the most common side effects are from the medications you are taking and when they can occur.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is radiation therapy?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Radiation therapy uses powerful x-rays to destroy cancer cells. This treatment is not used to treat widespread cancer because radiation damages normal cells as well as cancer cells. When this happens, side effects can occur, such as skin changes, fatigue, and nausea. 

You may also have other side effects depending on the part of your body being treated. Look in the related questions area on this page for side effects from radiation treatment to specific areas of your body.</Content>

<Content id="0">Chemoradiation or chemoradiotherapy is the use of both chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the same treatment cycle. There are several benefits to treatment with combined chemotherapy and radiation. This treatment method can help to preserve the structure and functions of organs compared with surgery. Also, chemotherapy can improve how well radiation treatment works. And while radiation works to kill cancer cells locally, chemotherapy can kill cancer cells that have traveled to other locations in the body.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are targeted therapies?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Monoclonal Antibodies and anti-angiogenesis drugs are both considered targeted therapies. Each type of targeted therapy works differently, but all interfere with the ability of the cancer cell to grow, divide, repair or to communicate with other cells. They work by targeting specific features of cancer cells that normal cells don't have.  This allows targeted therapies to attack the cancer cells without damaging the normal cells. 

All medications can cause some side effects.  Look in the related questions area to find out more about what side effects you may have when taking a targeted therapy drug.   If your doctor has prescribed targeted therapies for you, you may also want to ask them about supportive care options.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is adenocarcinoma?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Adenocarcinoma of the lung, also called pulmonary adenocarcinoma is a form of non-small cell lung cancer. 

Adenocarcinoma is usually found in the outer parts of the lung. This type of cancer grows more slowly and forms smaller masses than the other types of non-small cell lung cancer. However, adenocarcinoma tends to spread widely at an early stage.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is adenocarcinoma?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Adenocarcinoma of the lung, also called pulmonary adenocarcinoma is a form of non-small cell lung cancer. 

Adenocarcinoma is usually found in the outer parts of the lung. This type of cancer grows more slowly and forms smaller masses than the other types of non-small cell lung cancer. However, adenocarcinoma tends to spread widely at an early stage.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is squamous-cell carcinoma?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Squamous-cell carcinoma of the lung is a type of non-small cell lung cancer. This type of lung cancer may first show up as abnormal cells in the mucus or the cells lining the airways many years before a tumor develops. These cells may be seen in a cytologic smear test or biopsy of cells lining the airways. When tumors do form, they are usually found in the larger airways of the lung called the bronchi. 

This type of cancer is difficult to detect on x-rays and usually causes no symptoms until it starts to block the large airways and causes infection, collapses part of the lung, or spreads to other parts of the body. 

This type of non-small cell lung cancer may spread to the lymph nodes in the chest early in the disease, it spreads more slowly outside the chest than other common types of lung cancer. 

Squamous-cell carcinoma is more common in men than in women, and is more common in people who smoke than most other types of lung cancer. For more information on squamous cell carcinoma, look in the Resources area of this page.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is non-small cell large cell carcinoma?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Non-small cell large cell carcinoma, also called large cell lung cancer, is a form of non-small cell cancer. Large cell lung cancers make up between 5% and 10% of all lung cancers. 

They usually start in the outer areas of the lungs. Because of their location, common early symptoms of lung cancer, such as a cough that won't go away and coughing up blood may not happen until later. Instead, early symptoms of large cell cancer include extreme tiredness, mild shortness of breath, and achiness in your back shoulder, or chest. They can also cause fluid to develop in the space between the lung and the chest wall. This can cause pain in your chest or side that worsens with a deep breath. 

Large cell carcinomas can also make hormone-like chemicals that can cause what is called paraneoplastic syndrome. Paraneoplastic syndrome can make you feel extremely tired, cause loss of appetite and weight loss. Other symptoms include weakness or clumsiness, changes in taste, smell, or sight, and problems with memory or thinking skills, or even sleep. These symptoms are often over looked because they can be the result of other health problems. This type of lung cancer tends to grow quickly and spread earlier than some other forms of non-small cell lung cancer.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are mouth sores (Mucositis)?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Mouth sores from cancer treatment are called oral mucositis. 

Chemotherapy and radiation kill cancer cells, but they also damage the cells lining the gastro-intestinal tract, which goes from the mouth to the anus. This causes the lining of the mouth to break down. 

Oral mucositis is one of the most common and often most difficult side effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. It can cause pain and make it difficult to eat and get enough nutrition, and can increase your risk of infection. Mucositis can not only impact your quality of life, it can also delay or limit treatment doses. For this reason, it is important that you let your health care team know as soon as you notice any of the symptoms of mucositis. 

Signs and symptoms of mucositis include:
&#8226; Red, shiny, or swollen mouth and gums 
&#8226; Blood in the mouth 
&#8226; Sores in the mouth or on the gums or tongue 
&#8226; Soreness or pain in the mouth or throat 
&#8226; Difficulty swallowing or talking 
&#8226; Feeling of dryness, mild burning, or pain when eating food 
&#8226; Soft, whitish patches or pus in the mouth or on the tongue  
&#8226; Increased mucus or thicker saliva in the mouth. 

Again, tell your health care team if you have any issues with sores in your mouth. Treating them early can save you a lot of pain and discomfort.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I prevent mucositis?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Mucositis is very common in people getting chemotherapy or radiation, and most people will have at least some mouth sores over the course of their treatment. Your health care team will do everything they can to help prevent mucositis while you're in treatment, but there are steps you can take to reduce mucositis as well. 

Before treatment, see a dentist who deals with cancer patients. If you need any dental work, such as a tooth extraction or cavities filled, it should be done at least one month before you start therapy so that your mouth can heal completely. 

Good oral care, including brushing and flossing regularly, can help prevent or decrease the severity of mucositis and, just as important, help prevent infection. Use a soft bristle toothbrush and mild tasting toothpastes with fluoride, and brush your teeth after each meal or at least 2 to 3 times each day. If you experience sensitivity or mouth sores, you may need to use foam toothbrushes with an antibacterial rinse. You should also gently floss your teeth only once daily. Rinsing your mouth regularly with salt water after meals and at bedtime is one of the best and most cost effective ways to removing debris and keep your mouth moist and clean. 

You should also avoid alcohol and spicy, hot, or acidic foods like lemons. Also avoid coarse foods that can damage the lining of your mouth, like very dry toast. Drink more liquids and try to include foods high in protein in your diet. 

If you smoke, it is extremely important that you stop. Your doctor may be able to prescribe medications to help you. 

Keep lips moist with moisturizers, but avoid using products with petroleum jelly, like Vaseline, because they can increase the risk of infection. 

And, if you wear dentures, make sure they fit properly and remove them whenever possible to expose your gums to air. You may need to stop wearing your dentures if your mouth sores are severe. 

It is important to keep ahead of mucositis to prevent it from becoming worse and delaying your treatment. Alert your health care team as soon as you notice any of the symptoms of mucositis so that they can help you keep it from getting worse.</Content>

<Content id="0">Treatment for non-small cell lung cancer at stages I and II is generally surgery to remove the tumor. The type of surgery your doctor will do depends on where the tumor is located and how big it is. 

Surgeons remove the tumor and some of the healthy tissue around it. The healthy tissue surrounding the tumor is called the "margin." The removed tissue will be looked at under a microscope to see how wide the margin of healthy tissue is. Doctors like to see a wide margin of healthy tissue around the tumor when it is removed because that means it is likely that they were successful in removing all of the cancer cells. If the margin of healthy tissue is narrow, your doctor may recommend another surgery to try to remove all the cancer cells, or radiation or chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells.</Content>

In a thoracoscopy, the thin, flexible tube, called a thoracoscope, is inserted through a small incision in the chest. This allows the surgeon to see inside the lungs, mediastinum, or the area between the lungs, and the pleura which is the membrane covering the lungs and lining the chest.</Content>

Some biopsies can be taken using a long thin needle that is inserted through the skin. This is called a thin needle aspiration biopsy. A thicker needle is used to get a larger sample, called a core needle biopsy. 

Some biopsies are done using a bronchoscope, which is a thin tube that is slid down your airway and has a camera and light on the end, as well as tools that take samples of tissue for the pathologist to look at under a microscope. Doctors use an ultrasound, a picture of your insides made using sound waves, to help guide the bronchoscope to where they want to get tissue samples. These procedures are called Esophageal Ultrasound Guided biopsies.</Content>

<Content id="0">Other biopsies require doctors to make incisions -- cuts in the skin -- so that they can get samples of lymph nodes that cannot be reached using a bronchoscope. 

A mediastinoscopy is surgery to look at the inside of the upper chest between and in front of the lungs. This area is called the mediastinum. 

During the test, a doctor makes a small cut, or incision, in the neck just above the breastbone or on the left side of the chest next to the breastbone. Then the doctor places a thin scope in the opening. A tissue sample, or biopsy, can be collected through the scope and then looked at under a microscope for lung problems. These problems might include infection, inflammation, or cancer. 

The lymph nodes just above the collar bones are called the supraclavicular lymph nodes. These nodes are sometimes biopsied through an incision as well.

<Content id="0">Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer treatment depends on where in the lung or other part of the body the cancer has spread. 

Cancer that has spread from one lung to the other, into the space surrounding the lungs, or into the fluid around lung or heart may be treated with surgery, or radiation therapy or both. 

If there is a separate tumor in the same lobe as the original tumor, or in a different lobe on the same side of the lung, surgery is recommended to remove the tumors. Surgery may be followed by chemotherapy and/or chemoradiation or radiation treatment depending on whether the pathologist finds cancer cells in the border around the tissue that is removed from the lung. 

Although it is rare, lung cancer that has spread to only one other part of the body outside of the chest may be treated with surgery, radiation or both. When lung cancer spreads outside of the chest area, it usually spreads to more than one location, in these cases, treatment depends on features of the tumor cells called mutations and biomarkers.</Content>

Supportive care is an important component of treatment at this stage.  Studies have shown that patients with metastatic lung cancer live longer and have better quality of life when receiving supportive or palliative care than they do when they are receiving aggressive medical treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation.  Discuss supportive care options with your care team and make sure they understand your treatment goals.</Content>

<Content id="0">There are two types of stage two lung cancers. 

Stage 2A tumors are between 5 and 7 cm wide and have not spread to nearby lymph nodes. Stage 2A also describes a smaller tumor, less than 5 cm wide, when there are signs that the cancer has spread to the nearby lymph nodes. 

Stage 2B describes tumors between 5 and 7 cm that have spread to nearby lymph nodes, or a tumor between 5-7 cm wide that may have grown into other nearby parts of the lung, but has not spread to nearby lymph nodes. Sometimes these tumors can be removed by surgeons, but patients may also need additional treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What can I do if I have mouth sores from mucositis?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Treatment for mucositis involves keeping the mouth moisturized, preventing infection, and managing pain. Some easy remedies include chewing ice chips, chewing sugarless gum, or sucking tart sugar free candy. 

There are also over-the-counter products that can help with dry mouth, and if necessary, your doctor can prescribe one for you as well. 

You can use a soft bristle toothbrush to every 4 hours and at bedtime. It is important to brush and floss very gently to avoid additional damage. Rinse your mouth frequently with antiseptic mouth rinses, such as Peridex or Periogard, to prevent infections and inflammation. 

Your doctor may need to prescribe other medications to treat infections in your mouth. Pain from mucositis can prevent you from getting enough nutrition as eating and swallowing become difficult. If pain is mild, using ice chips or pops can help. If pain is worse, oral pain relief gels or lozenges may be used. Your doctor can also prescribe additional medications to help with pain from mucositis.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is cryotherapy?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Cryotherapy kills cancer cells by freezing them. It is also called cryosurgery or cryoablation. 

Cryotherapy is used if a tumor is blocking an airway and traditional surgery is not an option. 

Cryotherapy is done in a clinic or outpatient area of a hospital, meaning that you can usually return home after surgery. 

Before the procedure you will get medicine through a small tube put into a vein in your hand to make you fall asleep. During the procedure, your doctor will put a long, thin, flexible tube called a bronchoscope down your throat and into the airway. A special tool is then put through the bronchoscope tube. This tool freezes one section of the tumor at a time until they have treated the whole area. Then doctors remove the tissue through the bronchoscope tube. This normally takes about 30 minutes. 

Once you are fully awake and recovered from the procedure, you should be able to go home, and to eat and drink normally. 

After surgery, your throat and chest may be a bit sore for a few days, but you should be able to breath more easily than before. You may also cough up tissue or see a small amount of blood in your saliva for a few days after cryotherapy. But, if you are coughing up blood, or having more difficulty breathing, let your health care team know immediately.</Content>

<Content id="0">Before treatment for limited stage small cell lung cancer, tests will be done to determine where it has spread and how best to treat it. If there is a buildup of too much fluid the space that surrounds the lungs, doctors may do a Thoracentesis or Thoracoscopy. 

Thoracentesis involves using a needle to withdraw fluid from the chest area around the lungs or heart. The fluid is then looked at under a microscope to see there are cancer cells in it. 

In thoracoscopy the thin, flexible tube, called a thoracoscope, is inserted through a small incision in the chest. A very small camera on the thoracoscope allows the surgeon to see the lungs, the area between the lungs called the mediastinum, and the membrane covering the lungs and the lining of the chest cavity, called the pleura.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the different types of lung cancer?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The two most common types of lung cancer are non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. 

About 80 percent of lung cancers are non-small cell cancer. These types describe the type of cancer cells that make up the tumor. The second most common type is small cell lung cancer. 

10% to 15% of lung cancers are small cell lung cancer. 

There are other very rare types of lung cancer called carcinoids which includes adenoid cystic carcinomas, lymphomas, and sarcomas, as well as benign lung tumors such as hamartomas.  Carcinoids are slow growing and are usually treated with surgery. 

This program focuses on non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer because they are the most common. You can find links to information on these and other more rare types of lung cancer in the Resources area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are brain metastases?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Brain metastases mean that your original cancer has spread to the brain. If your doctor suspects that your cancer has spread to your brain, your care team will do additional tests such as an MRI or CT scan. A biopsy may also be needed. 

Symptoms of brain metastases include headaches, speech difficulties, seizures, nausea and vomiting, weakness of an arm or leg, or problems with your eyesight If brain metastases are causing seizures, you may be given an anti-seizure medicine. Corticosteroids, often just called steroids, are used to reduce swelling and may make many of your symptoms go away quickly. But this does not mean that the tumor is gone. 

Because most chemotherapy drugs are not able to enter the brain, treatment of brain metastases is usually radiation therapy or surgery.If you have a single brain lesion that is in part of the brain where it is safe to operate, surgery may be recommended. Surgery for brain metastases may be done by opening your skull and removing the tumor, or it may be done using pinpoint radiation therapy called Stereotactic Radiosurgery. 

If surgery is not an option, whole brain radiotherapy may be used to shrink tumors and keep them from growing. In most cases, once cancer spreads to the brain, the cancer is not curable, but it can be treated to reduce the side effects. With current treatments, patients can live from months to years, depending on the number of brain metastases, the type of tumor, and the amount of cancer present in the rest of the body.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is liver metastases?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">The liver is a common site for metastases because it gets lots of blood and provides a welcome environment for cancer cells to grow. 

Signs of liver metastases include vomiting more than twice a day for more than one day, having blood in your vomit, weight loss, black bowel movements, difficulty swallowing, new swelling in the legs or abdomen and jaundice or yellowing of the skin. Your liver may also feel enlarged or misshapen when the doctor examines you, and you may have pain in the upper right part of your stomach. 

If your doctor thinks your cancer may have spread to your liver, you may need to have a liver function test. Various scans such as a CT scan, ultrasound or MRI might be done on your liver. An angiogram or laparoscopy may also be done. 

Drug therapy, usually chemotherapy, is used to treat most cases of lung cancer that has spread to your liver. Chemotherapy may be given through an IV if there are metastases in other locations as well as the liver. Or, chemotherapy can be injected directly into the liver. 

Radiofrequency Ablation and Microwave ablation may be done to shrink tumors. Embolization is also used to shrink liver metastases by reducing the blood supply that the tumor needs to grow. 

Surgery is usually only done if there are only a few areas affected by tumors. Chemotherapy may be used after surgery as well. 

How well patients do depends on the location of the original cancer and how much it has spread to the liver. In most cases, cancer that has spread to the liver is not curable. However, treatment may help shrink tumors, improve life expectancy, and relieve symptoms. In a small number of cases, surgery to remove the liver tumors may lead to a cure.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is adrenal gland metastases?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Adrenal glands are small glands that sit on top of the kidneys. They produce hormones, including cortisol, epinephrine, commonly called adrenaline, and norepinephrine. Up to 40 percent of people with lung cancer will develop adrenal metastases. 

Symptoms of adrenal gland metastases include back pain, abdominal pain, and bleeding into the abdomen. Another sign of metastases to these glands is adrenal insufficiency, also called Addison's disease, which is a group of symptoms including weakness, low blood pressure, low blood sugar, and low sodium and high potassium in the blood. 

If your doctor thinks your cancer might have spread to your adrenal glands, you may be sent for a scan such as a CT or MRI. In some cases, a CT-guided biopsy will be done to confirm the diagnosis. 

Treatment of adrenal gland metastases includes chemotherapy, targeted therapies or radiation therapy. Surgery to remove one or both of the adrenal glands may be done, especially if the tumor is bleeding or at risk of bleeding. Stereotactic body radiotherapy may be another option if surgery is not advised. If the metastasis has resulted in adrenal insufficiency, treatment with steroids may be needed. 

The prognosis for adrenal metastases from lung cancer may be better than the prognosis of other metastases - such as those to the liver, brain, and bones.</Content>

<Content id="0">Bone metastases can cause severe pain, and bone fractures. They can also cause levels of minerals and vitamins in your body, called electrolytes, to become out of balance, which can be life-threatening. Bone metastases can also press on nerves which can cause pain, weakness, or numbness and tingling sensation in the feet and legs. Nerve compression may also cause problems with bowel and bladder function. This may result in incontinence, meaning that you cannot control your urine or bowel movements; or in constipation or urinary retention, meaning that it is difficult to urinate or have a bowel movement. If the metastases are pressing on the spinal cord, you may have weakness in your legs and find it hard to move them. Spinal cord compression is an emergency and you should get immediate medical attention. A less common symptom of bone metastasis is high levels of calcium in the body. High calcium can cause constipation, and abdominal pain. If calcium levels are very high, it can affect the brain, causing you to become confused and have problems thinking clearly. This is also an emergency and you should report any of these symptoms to your doctor.</Content>

<Content id="0">ALK rearrangement mutations affect the anaplastic lymphoma kinase or ALK gene. In these mutations, the genes become rearranged and joined with another gene. This causes cancer cells to grow and spread faster than normal cells. Tumors with the ALK mutations are treated with targeted medications called tyrosine kinase inhibitors or TKIs. 

Two TKIs used to treat non-small cell lung cancer with the ALK mutation are Crizotinib (Xalkori) or ceritinib (Zykadia). Generally, these medications are given as a pill that you take by the mouth. As with any treatments, these medications have side effects than can be serious. For more information on TKIs, look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I participate in my cancer care?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">One of the most important things you have to do on your cancer journey is take an active role in managing your illness. Here's what that means: If you have questions -- ask your doctor.  They want you to be well informed so that you can make treatment decisions that are right for you. Taking an active role also means keeping your treatment appointments and taking your medication how and when you're supposed to. You don't want to skip appointments or doses of your medications because your treatments might not be as effective. You also need to report symptoms and side effects so that they don't get in the way of your treatments. Discuss even mild side effects with your health care team because some side effects may become serious and delay or stop you from getting all of your cancer treatments. Try to eat a healthy diet and stay as physically active as you are able to, although it may be challenging if you're feeling tired and you've lost your appetite. Many of our patients find that being physically active actually increases their energy.  Quitting smoking will also be beneficial to your treatment and your doctor can help support you if you decide to quit.  Ask your doctor what other changes you can make to support your treatment. And remember, the decisions on what treatments are best for you are yours, not your family's or other caregivers'.  You and your doctor know what is best given your treatment goals.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What do I need to know about undergoing cancer treatment?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">So, before we start talking about specific medical treatments, I want to talk to you a little bit about what it's like to be treated for cancer, no matter what type or stage of cancer you have. We've heard from many people with cancer and their caregivers, that they didn't understand the demands that their cancer treatment would place on them and their loved ones. Depending on your specific treatment plan, you may need to get treatment several times a week, even daily. And, you may have to get frequent blood work, scans and other tests. You may find that you need help with transportation and keeping track of your medications, appointments and all paperwork as well. So, when discussing treatment with your doctor, make sure you find out how often and how long you will need to be at the treatment center, what kinds of tests will be done and how often they will be needed. It's important to ask your care team about this and what side effects are common with your treatment. Side effects, such as fatigue and nausea, can make it difficult to keep working, or even to do everyday tasks.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Will I have side effects?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Most patients will have some side effects from their cancer treatments. The severity of side effects varies from treatment to treatment and person to person, and side effects can have a big impact on your lifestyle and your outlook, especially if they are severe. Many side effects can be successfully treated, so it is important to talk to your oncology nurse as soon as you begin experiencing any side effects. I want to stress to you that if you do experience side effects, do skip your cancer treatments or stop taking your medication exactly as instructed unless your healthcare provider tells you to. If some side effects become too severe, it may cause a delay or change to your treatment.  Another reason to report side effects quickly is that some side effects, if not treated early, can become quite serious, even life threatening. Do not take any physical symptoms you may have lightly. If you have chest pain or trouble breathing call 911 immediately.  No matter what treatment you're getting, you need to call your oncologists office.  If the you have any of these symptoms: #8226 A temperature over 100.4.  #8226 Stomach swelling, tenderness, or pain #8226; Dark urine #8226 Bloody or dark stool #8226 Moderate to severe pain or cramps #8226 or Nausea or vomiting despite taking anti-nausea medications.  Remember that AHN's After Hours Oncology Clinic is available from 3 pm until 9pm weekdays.  For information on the After Hours Clinic, look in the Resources area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is shortness of breath?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Shortness of breath, called dyspnea, is common for people with lung cancer. Breathing can be uncomfortable and you may feel like you can't get enough air into your lungs. It is important to tell your doctor if you are having difficulty breathing so he or she can determine the cause. Shortness of breath can be caused by a tumor in or near an airway, inflammation in the lung from radiation treatments, fluid buildup around the lungs, called pleural effusion, or the heart, called pericardial effusion. Stress and anxiety may cause you to feel like you can't breathe, too. No matter what the cause, shortness of breath can be a frightening experience. Manage anxiety by taking slow, steady, deep breaths, and try to visualize a setting that relaxes and calms you. Try to stay focused on the setting and breathe slowly. There are things you can do to prevent or reduce the times that you feel short of breath. First of all, if you smoke, try to quit. Your health care provider can help you stop smoking with medication if necessary. And, avoid smoky places.  Try to stay healthy. Wash your hands frequently, and stay clear of people who are sick to avoid getting infections. Talk to your doctor about whether using an incentive spirometer, which is a device designed to improve lung function, might help improve your breathing. Drink lots of liquids to stay hydrated. This can help thin mucus and make coughing easier. Using a humidifier or a vaporizer may help thin mucus and make coughing easier, too. Try light exercise, if possible. Exercise can help increase the flow of oxygen to your blood. Sleeping with your head raised on pillows may make it easier to breathe at night. Talk to your doctor about whether seeing a respiratory therapist or getting supplemental oxygen would be helpful.  There is information on support for quitting smoking in the Resources area.</Content>

<Content id="0">Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms experienced by people with cancer. Most patients describe this as much more than just feeling tired. It is a feeling of complete exhaustion where even the smallest effort seems impossible. Usually, it comes on suddenly and is not the result of activity or strain, and is not relieved by rest or sleep. Fatigue can be can be caused by many things, so it is important to tell your health care team if you notice a change in your energy level.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are sleep problems?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Sleep problems are reported by up to 90 percent of patients with cancer. Some people find it difficult to sleep because they are in pain or they have restless legs syndrome (RLS) which can be caused by some cancer treatments. Often times, cancer drugs cause people to feel tired and sleepy throughout the day. They end up napping or sleeping during the day and that leads to difficulty sleeping at night. Sometimes sleep problems are caused by medications prescribed to combat side effects of the chemotherapy. Stress and tension about your diagnosis and treatment can also cause sleep problems. It is important to report any sleep issues to your doctor. Sleep is important for people with cancer -- it restores the energy you need to fight your cancer, and is essential for reducing anxiety and depression. Stress actually weakens your body's immune system. Lack of sleep can also impact levels of hormones that affect how cancer cells behave. Talk to your doctor or oncology nurse about sleep problems, there are a number of things you can do to improve sleep: &#8226; Do not eat or exercise within 2 hours of bedtime &#8226; Make your room dark. &#8226; Use the bed only for sleeping, not for watching TV or reading &#8226; Keep a consistent sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day &#8226; Make sure you are taking your medications at the right time of day &#8226; And cut down on caffeine and avoid drinking caffeine in the evening. &#8226; If you are still having problems sleeping try keeping a sleep diary to show to your doctor. Depending on the reasons you are having trouble sleeping, your health care provider may prescribe medication to help you sleep better.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Will I have pain?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Lung cancer patients may experience pain from many different sources, whether from tumors in the lungs, metastases to other parts of the body, or from cancer treatments themselves. Make sure to tell your cancer treatment team about any pain you are having. It is important to stay on top of your pain and follow the directions for any pain medications your doctor gives you. It is easier to treat pain if you stick to a medication schedule and do not skip doses. Opioids are commonly prescribed to ease cancer pain. These are strong medications that block pain signals in the brain. Other medications may be used along with them. These pain killers can cause side effects of their own, including constipation, so alert your doctor to any changes in your health.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Does cancer cause depression?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A cancer diagnosis may cause anyone to feel sad or down, but when that sadness persists and affects your usual activities you may be depressed. Depression can also be a side effect of many cancer drugs. It could be a sign that your cancer medication or treatment needs to be adjusted. Do not wait to contact your health care team if you think you may be depressed. If un-treated, depression only gets worse. The sooner you let your health care team know how you are feeling, the sooner you can find relief. Your doctor may prescribe anti-depressants. Remember it can take up to two weeks for anti-depressant medication to begin working. You may also be referred to a counselor to help you find ways to cope with your situation. Getting professional help for depression is just as important as taking your medications. Check the Resource Area for more on the symptoms and treatment of depression.</Content>

<Content id="0">It is not unusual to experience some anxiety when you are diagnosed with cancer and at different times during treatment. If your anxiety interferes with your normal activities or relationships, you need to let your health care team know about it. There are medications that may help and referrals for other types of therapies have been shown to be effective. Some symptoms of anxiety are: &#8226; Excessive worry about events or activities &#8226; Muscle tension &#8226; Sleep changes- either being unable to sleep or sleeping more than usual &#8226; Physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, sweating, palpitations, trembling, shortness of breath, chest tightness, nausea, diarrhea, flushing, dizziness, or high blood pressure. &#8226; Exhaustion &#8226; Difficulty concentrating &#8226; And irritability or restlessness. Activities that may help relieve anxiety are: &#8226; Progressive muscle relaxation exercises &#8226; Meditation &#8226; Yoga &#8226; Listening to music or participating in Music Therapy &#8226; Massage &#8226; Engaging in your usual spiritual activities &#8226; And physical activity.</Content>

<Content id="0">When talking about a cancer diagnosis, some people feel that it's important to get all of the details about their prognosis right from the start.  They want to know how the cancer will affect them and how long they can expect to live. Other people prefer not to discuss their prognosis right away.  They may feel that knowing their prognosis is depressing or bad luck.  But we want you to be fully informed at each step of your treatment because knowing the prognosis for your specific type and stage of cancer can help you better participate in your care, make treatment decisions and plan for the future.  So, I have a very important question to ask you. Do you want to learn more about your prognosis now, or do you want to come back to this topic at another time?</Content>

<Content id="0">That's okay. Many people choose not to learn the details about their prognosis right away. I hope you don't mind if I bring this topic up again periodically.  It really is very important that you understand all of your options so that you can make treatment decisions that are right for you.  But, you don't have to wait for me to bring it up, if you should decide on your own to explore prognosis information at any time, you can start the discussion by typing "prognosis information" into the text box. Just to be sure, I'll ask you again whether you want to learn more about your prognosis. If you reply yes, we can talk about what your cancer diagnosis means in terms of life expectancy and the possibility of being cured.  Keep in mind that statistics are estimates, educated guesses that describe trends in large numbers of people. These statistics do not necessarily predict what will actually happen to you. These numbers can't tell you how long you will live, but they may help give you a better understanding about how likely it is that your treatment will be useful.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Answer to question 008 I want information on my prognosis</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Alright, you want to know as much information as possible about what your prognosis is.  But first, there are a few things I want you to remember when learning about your prognosis. 

Doctors often use the 5-year survival rate when talking about prog-no-sees. This is the percentage of people with a specific type and stage of cancer that are alive at least 5 years after their cancer diagnosis. But many people live longer -- often much longer -- than 5 years. 

For example, a 5-year survival rate of 50% means that an estimated 50 out of 100 people who have that cancer are still alive 5 years after being diagnosed. And many of those people have many years yet to go. 

These numbers can't tell you how long you will live, but they may help give you a better understanding about how likely it is that your treatment will be useful.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What do I need to know about prognosis statistics?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Before we get into the specific prognosis for your type of cancer, there are a few things I need to tell you. First, keep in mind that there have been many advances in treatments since these statistics were calculated, and that people who are now being diagnosed with lung cancer may have a better outlook than someone diagnosed five years ago. Also, these statistics are based on the stage of the cancer when it was first diagnosed. They do not apply to cancers that later come back or spread. And lastly, remember that many factors can affect your prognosis, such as the type of cancer, gene changes in the cancer cells, your age, overall health and performance status, other health conditions you may have, and how well your cancer responds to treatment.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">DO NOT USE  What is the survival rate for extensive (stages II-IV) small cell lung cancer?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">DO NOT USE The median survival time for extensive stage small cell lung cancer is 4.5 months.  Survival time depends upon the type of metastases.  Median survival time of patients with brain metastases was 9 months while median survival time of patients with metastases in other locations at primary diagnosis was 11 months.  

With treatment, for stage II small cell lung cancer, the 5-year relative survival rate is about 19% which means that out of every 100 patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer, 19 individuals lived for a minimum of 5 years after their diagnosis.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What to expect from cancer treatment?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">We've talked many people with cancer and their caregivers, and what they tell us is that they weren't prepared for how cancer treatment affected every area of their life. Depending on your specific treatment plan, you may need to get treatment several times a week, and you may have to get frequent blood work, scans and other tests. You may find that you need help with transportation and keeping track of the paperwork, medications and appointments as well. The side effects can make it difficult to keep working, or even to do every day tasks. So, when discussing treatment with your doctor, make sure you find out how often you will need to go into the treatment center, what kinds of tests will be done and how often they will be needed. Another important topic to ask your doctor about is what side effects you can expect from your treatment.</Content>

<Content id="0">One of the main roles that caregivers fill is that of organizer. As with every serious illness, there will be a lot of information to keep track of. Depending on your loved one abilities, this role may start off small, then grow more important and time consuming. It is a good idea to keep a journal that contains the phone numbers of your loved one's health care team and others who provide support such as neighbors,other friends and family and community services. Make sure you get the after-hours numbers for doctors so that you can reach a member of the health care team at any time. This journal can also be used to track information about appointments, including which health care provider was seen and what they said. All medications that your loved one takes should be tracked in the journal as well, including any vitamins or other supplements, eye drops, medication patches, and over-the-counter medications. Keep track of the dose, when and how often it is taken, and any other instructions such as whether a medication should be taken with or without food.</Content>

Understanding what is covered by insurance, and what co-pays and out-of-pocket expenses will be is very important so that these costs can be tracked.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What precautions should I take with oral oncology medications?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are now some chemotherapy and other cancer medications that are taken by mouth rather than by IV and these medications can be taken at home. They are just as powerful as the treatments given in cancer treatment clinics, so caregivers and other family members must be careful not to touch these medications. Also, make sure you take these special precautions to stay safe when handling body fluids from people who are taking cancer medications: &#8226; If you are helping someone take their medication at home, wear disposable gloves and throw them in the regular household trash when done. Used gloves should not be re-used for anything else. &#8226; Keep all drugs out of reach of children and pets. &#8226; Pregnant caregivers should not handle oral cancer drugs &#8226; Cancer drugs should remain in their original packaging until used &#8226; Do not let the medication come in contact with household surfaces like countertops or tables, and if they do, clean the surface thoroughly afterwards to prevent others from coming into contact with traces of the medication. &#8226; When giving someone their medication, put the pill into a medication cup. Then they can tip the cup to their mouth to take the pills &#8226; Pill containers for cancer drugs should never be reused &#8226; Oral cancer drugs should not be crushed, split, broken or chewed. &#8226; It takes about 72 hours for the body to break down or get rid of most cancer drugs. During that time, a small amount of the drug comes out in urine, stool, vomit and blood. You should avoid any items that have been soiled with body fluids. Clothing, sheets and towels that have body fluids on them should be kept in plastic bags until washed, and should be washed separately from other laundry.</Content>

And, while it is usually safe to have sex with someone taking cancer meds, your loved one should discuss this with their health care team. Condoms may be required since the cancer drugs can be found in semen and vaginal fluid. Also, patients of childbearing age should avoid getting pregnant while taking cancer drugs.

<Content id="0">In addition to helping your loved one organize and take their medications, you can help them avoid dangerous food and drug interactions. Some cancer medications may interact with other prescription or over-the-counter drugs as well as herbal medicines and even some foods. The chances of a drug interaction increase with the number of medications being taken. This is very important because some medicines can affect how well cancer drugs work and may also cause adverse side effects or dangerous drug interactions. Take your loved one's list of medications to each doctor's appointment and make sure you ask about any possible drug/food interactions. You can also read the insert included with your cancer medication. It will list any possible adverse reactions with other drugs or food.

<Content id="0">If your loved one needs full time caregiving, you may be eligible for Family Medical Leave through the Family Medical Leave Act or FMLA.  This federal law guarantees up to 12 weeks of time off per year to care for a seriously ill family member. While you are on Family Medical Leave, your job and insurance are protected. Some states have similar laws that provide additional coverage beyond what the federal law mandates. 

If you do take family medical leave, you will not be paid. This can be a financial burden for many people. Check with your state to see if they have programs to pay caregivers of people with serious illness. For more information on the FMLA and other assistance, look in the Resources area.</Content>

<Content id="0">Transportation to and from the hospital, clinic and doctor's office visits is a vital service for someone who is being treated for cancer. There are often several medical appointments each week and the side effects of cancer treatment can make it difficult to drive or take public transportation. If you live nearby and are able to drive, that's great. If you're not able to drive because of work or because you live too far away, you can help coordinate transportation for your loved one with neighbors, friends and other family who are willing to help out, or you can arrange for a car service or courtesy van from the hospital or clinic. Whether you'll be doing the driving or someone else, planning for the transportation includes knowing the exact address including suite number where the appointment is at, where to park and whether there is a parking fee, how far your loved one will need to walk and which entrance to the building is most convenient. Will your loved one need a wheelchair or other assistance to get to the appointment? And, how long will the appointment last? All of this preparation will make for a less stressful experience for both patient and driver. For other transportation tips, look in the Resources area.</Content>

<Content id="0">Cancer symptoms and treatment side effects can impact cancer treatment, sometimes delaying or stopping future treatments. So, it's important for you as a caregiver to know what side effects to look for, how to treat them and keep them from getting worse. You should also know when to call the doctor about serious side effects. Even though reporting side effects may impact treatment, it is important that you and your loved report all the side effects that they experience. There are many things that health care providers can recommend to lessen side effects and keep your loved one's treatment on schedule. We'll go over the symptoms that your loved one may have and some things that you can do to help. Keep track of any symptoms and treatments in a log or journal and note the type of side effect or symptom, how often they have it, when it started, is there anything that makes it better or worse, how severe it is on a scale from 1 to 10, and how it is affecting your loved one's daily activities. Having this information available quickly can make it easier for health care providers to treat symptoms and side effects and may save you some trips to the doctor's office or emergency room. There are some tools to help you track symptoms and side effects in the tools area.</Content>

Your doctor or nurse will ask you if you have noticed any changes from your last appointment. It is very important to tell them how you have been feeling or if you have any concerns. You will have blood work drawn to make sure your immune system is healthy enough to continue with your chemotherapy. You will be sitting in a chair that is able to recline. There will be space for one other person to come and stay with you. Your oncology nurse will start an IV or access your implanted venous access device or "port" if you have one. You will then get your pre-meds that will help prevent side effects. These may be pills or thru your IV. Your nurse will talk you through everything that she is doing.  There is a curtain to pull for privacy. Most treatment areas have TV's. But you can bring an Ipod or tablet with you to use, or a book to read while you get your chemotherapy.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What should I know about oral chemotherapy medications?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Some chemotherapy medications can be taken in pill form at home. These oral chemotherapy drugs are just as powerful as the ones that you would get at a treatment center. It is very important to take the oral chemotherapy medication how and when your doctor has told you. 

There are a number of reasons why someone might not want to take their medication -- side effects can be challenging to deal with, and drugs that treat cancer can be very expensive. If you are concerned about how the oral chemotherapy is making you feel or the cost of the medications is becoming too much please call your doctor's office before you skip doses or consider cutting them in half. 

Oral cancer drugs should not be crushed, split, cut in half or chewed. Also, your treatment will not be as effective and your cancer may get worse if you do not get the full dose that your doctor has prescribed. Your doctors and nurses know that these medications cause side effects and they can often suggest ways to manage the side effects that these medications have on your health. They also know how expensive the medications can be and can point you towards a less expensive treatment or help you find resources to help you pay for your treatment. If, for any reason, you are thinking about skipping treatments or changing the dose of any of your medications, please talk to your doctor or nurse before you do.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is bone marrow suppression?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Bone marrow suppression is one of the most common side effects that causes cancer treatment to be delayed or changed. The bone marrow is the spongy tissue in the center of the bones that makes red cells, white cells and platelets.  Some cancer drugs can cause the bone marrow to produce fewer blood cells. A drop in the levels of any of these cells can lead to side effects It can cause several significant dangers for cancer patients. One of the biggest dangers is infection. White blood cells fight infection. A low white blood cell count significantly increases your risk of infection. 

There is nothing you can do to raise your white blood cell count on your own, but there are things you can do to reduce your risk of infection. They include: &#8226; Wash your hands often during the day, especially before you eat and use the bathroom &#8226; Shower or bathe daily,&#8226; Stay away from crowds &#8226; Avoid contact with anyone who is sick &#8226; Do not have dental work done while your white blood cell count is low. &#8226; Be careful not to cut or nick yourself &#8226; Wear gloves when working in the garden. &#8226; Avoid emptying or handling pet waste &#8226; And wear a face mask if your counts are low and you need to in a crowded area.

 Even if you are very careful your body may still not be able to fight infections. Some symptoms of infection are: &#8226; Temperature at or over 100.4 degrees &#8226; Chills &#8226; Sweating &#8226; Painful urination &#8226; A bad cough or sore throat &#8226; Diarrhea.   It is important to be alert to any change in how you feel and report any sign of infection to your doctor or nurse immediately If your white blood count gets too low, your doctor may prescribe a shot that can help your bone marrow produce more white blood cells.</Content>

<Content id="0">Bone marrow suppression can also cause anemia, which is a low red blood cell count. Red blood cells carry oxygen and nutrients throughout the body, so a low red blood cell count can make you feel very tired and weak. To see if you have a low red blood count, your doctor may order a blood test called complete blood count or CBC. 

Symptoms of a low red blood cell count, or anemia, often start slowly, so you may not even notice them at first. However, as your red blood cell count gets lower, the symptoms will become more severe. The symptoms of anemia are: &#8226; Fatigue &#8226; Weakness &#8226; Shortness of breath &#8226; A racing heartbeat &#8226; Dizziness or lightheadedness &#8226; Headaches &#8226; Chest Pain &#8226; Or Pale skin.  You should contact your healthcare team if you notice any of these symptoms. Get immediate help if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, racing heartbeat, dizziness or lightheadedness.

Depending your situation, your doctor may prescribe medication, an iron supplement, multivitamin, a high protein diet or even a blood transfusion.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a low blood platelet count?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Bone marrow suppression can also cause a low blood platelet count. A low platelet count puts you at increased risk of bleeding and bruising. Platelets are colorless blood cells that help blood clot. They line the inside of the blood vessel. When you have a low platelet count this layer thins and tiny drops of blood can leak through the spaces made when the layers thin. This can cause red dots on the skin called petechia (pa-TEE-kee-eye).</Content>

<Content id="0">Pneumonitis is inflammation of lung tissue. Difficulty breathing and a dry cough are the most common symptoms of pneumonitis. You may also have shortness of breath. Pneumonitis can be caused by some chemotherapy medications or radiation therapy to the lungs. Usually pneumonitis is treated with corticosteroid medications to reduce the swelling in the lung or its lining.  Oxygen therapy through a mask or plastic tubing with prongs that fit into your nostrils may also be used to help you breathe While the swelling goes down. If you notice any of the symptoms of pneumonitis, we encourage you to call your doctor immediately.</Content>

<Content id="0">Diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel movements. This side effect can be mild or severe. Mild diarrhea is having less than 4 liquid bowel movements in 24 hours. Severe diarrhea is having more than 5 liquid bowel movements in 24 hours.

 If severe diarrhea is not managed it may cause serious problems, and can even be life threatening. If it is serious, your doctor may need to reduce your chemotherapy dose or even delay your treatment. 

If you have diarrhea, let your doctor or nurse know. Your doctor may be able to prescribe medication to help you and may encourage you to try a low fiber diet high in protein and calories like: refined breads and cereals, applesauce, canned fruits, well cooked meat and fish.  

If you are having liquid or frequent bowel movements it's important to keep your rectal area clean. You may need to use baby wipes and an over the counter barrier cream to protect your skin.  

Also, be aware of the signs of dehydration which include &#8226; Increased thirst &#8226; Dry mouth and swollen tongue &#8226; Weakness &#8226; Dizziness &#8226; Palpitations or feeling that the heart is jumping or pounding &#8226; Confusion &#8226; Sluggishness &#8226; Fainting &#8226; Inability to sweat &#8226; And decreased urine output.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is nausea?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Nausea is the feeling of needing or wanting to vomit, and vomiting is the act of throwing up. Nausea and vomiting can become serious if it prevents you from taking or keeping down your medication, food and liquids. It can affect how well your treatment works and can make it necessary for the doctors to reduce your doses or even delay your treatment. There are medications your doctor can prescribe to reduce nausea and vomiting, so let them know if you are having problems with nausea or vomiting. Often times anti-nausea medications are given to you prior to receiving your chemotherapy. These medications can help to reduce the feeling nausea and decrease vomiting.  To help with nausea try eating small, frequent meals and avoiding spicy, fatty, or sweet, or highly salted foods. Some patients also find music therapy and relaxation helps with nausea and vomiting.  If you are vomiting it is important to replace lost fluids in order to avoid becoming dehydrated. Drink fluids throughout the day like water or flavored water, Gatorade, and juices. A good goal to keep you hydrated is to try to drink 8 ounces of fluid every 2 hours.  Be aware of the signs of dehydration which include &#8226; Increased thirst &#8226; Dry mouth and swollen tongue &#8226; Weakness &#8226; Dizziness &#8226; Palpitations or feeling that the heart is jumping or pounding &#8226; Confusion &#8226; Sluggishness &#8226; Fainting &#8226; Inability to sweat &#8226; And decreased urine output.

<BaseQuestion id="0">Does chemotherapy or radiation cause problems with memory and thinking?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Some people taking chemotherapy or radiation treatment may experience memory problems or a mental cloudiness, which is sometimes called "Chemo Brain". Patients often describe trouble concentrating, forgetfulness, trouble multi-tasking, taking longer to finish things and trouble remembering common words.  For most people, these changes last only a short time, but for others it can go on for years and can affect your everyday life. So, tell your healthcare team about any changes in your thinking or behavior that begins to affect your lifestyle. There are also some physical conditions than can cause confusion.

<BaseQuestion id="0">Will my hair fall out?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">One of the most distressing side effects from cancer treatments is hair loss, also called alopecia. The scalp is not the only area affected. Hair found anywhere on the body, including eyebrows, eyelashes, facial hair, underarm hair and pubic hair can be affected. 

Not all patients lose their hair during cancer treatment. You may lose all your hair or just some; all depends on the kind of treatment you are getting. Some cancer drugs can also cause changes in the texture, color, and growth pattern of your hair. Hair loss doesn't happen overnight. It is usually a gradual process happening over one to three weeks after the first treatment. For others, it may happen over several treatment cycles. 

Your hair will not instantly grow back once treatment is done. It may take three to six months after you finish therapy for your hair to grow back. Typically, hair loss is temporary, but when it does come back new hair may have a slightly different color, texture or curl.

If you do lose your hair you should gently wash your scalp and watch for any signs of infection. If you develop crusty lesions on the skin or scalp report it to your health care team. You may need to be checked for infection. 

Hair loss can lead to depression, anxiety, and social isolation. It is also a constant, visual reminder of your cancer diagnosis. Choosing to wear a wig is a personal preference. If you decide you want to wear a wig, check with your insurance company. Many plans will cover part or all of the cost of a wig if your doctor writes a prescription. Ask for a prescription for an "extra-cranial prosthesis" that is, a wig! If you don't have coverage, call your local chapter of the American Cancer Society or your cancer center. They may offer free wigs. For more information on picking a wig or other options for head coverings, check out the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why doesn't food taste the same since I started treatment?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Taste changes are common during cancer treatment. About 50% of people getting treatment experience taste changes. The exact reason for this is not clear, but it might be a result of the damage to the cells in the oral cavity, which are especially sensitive to cancer drugs. Many people say they can no longer tolerate spicy foods and describe most food as tasting bland, bitter or like chemicals. These changes may occur during your drug therapy and last for hours, days, weeks, or even months after treatment stops. There are no medications to help with taste changes, but there are things you can do to increase your appetite. Make sure to call your doctor if your taste changes have caused you to stop eating and you have lost 5 pounds or more.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is prophylactic radiation?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Prophylactic radiation, meaning radiation to prevent the spread of cancer, is used for patients with small cell lung cancer because it is likely that cancer will spread, or metastasize, to the brain. This treatment uses a low dose of radiation and targets the entire brain, preventing tumors from forming. Although the dose of radiation is low, as with any treatment the side effects of this treatment must be measured against the potential benefits.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How does radiation affect the skin?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">	Radiation can cause dryness, itching, blistering, or peeling of their skin. But these side effects often depend on which part of the body received radiation therapy. These skin problems usually go away a few weeks after you stop getting radiation treatments. However, if skin damage becomes a serious problem, the doctor may change your treatment plan. Radiation recall is a rash that looks like a severe sunburn. Although rare, it occurs when certain types of chemotherapy are given during or soon after external beam radiation therapy. The rash appears on the part of the body that received radiation. Symptoms may include redness, tenderness, swelling, wet sores, and peeling skin. Typically, these side effects start within days or weeks of radiation therapy. But it can also appear months or years later. Doctors treat radiation recall with medications called corticosteroids. Rarely, you may wait until the skin heals before continuing chemotherapy. For information on how to care for your skin, look in the Resources area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a lobectomy?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Your lungs have 5 sections, called lobes. When a surgeon removes a whole lobe from your lung it is called a lobectomy. If necessary, part of the bronchus, the large airway, can be removed as well. This is called a sleeve lobectomy. These surgeries are done by a thoracic surgeon in an operating room and you will be given medication to make you go to sleep. You will also have a tube in your throat to help you breathe. The tube will not be removed until after you wake up from surgery and can breathe on your own. Recovery from a lobectomy depends on how much of your lung is removed and how healthy you were before surgery. You may experience shortness of breath for several months after the procedure while your lungs recover. This can be frustrating, especially if you were not having any trouble breathing before your surgery.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is stereotactic radiosurgery?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a large dose of radiation aimed very closely and accurately at a tumor. This treatment is used to treat brain metastases. Unlike traditional radiation, which is usually given daily over many weeks, SRS is given in either a single dose, called Gamma Knife� surgery, or in up to five doses, which is called Cyber knife� surgery. The accuracy of the Stereotactic radiosurgery beam allows a high dose of radiation to be delivered to the tumor, while leaving health tissue unharmed. Because of the need for accuracy with Gamma Knife surgery, you will not be able to move your head during surgery. A helmet or frame will be used to keep your head in place. Cyber knife surgery, however, uses a custom mask for each patient and a robot that follows a precise map of your skull to ensure accuracy. Cyber knife can accommodate larger lesions than gamma knife surgery and can also be used to treat other types of cancer outside the brain. Most patients can return to their usual daily activities after stereotactic radiosurgery.</Content>

Although immunotherapy drugs are sometimes said to have fewer and milder side effects than other treatments, that is not always the case and serious side effects may occur. Because immunotherapy drugs strengthen the effect of the on the body's own immune system, the immune system may start attacking other parts of the body, such as the lungs, intestines, liver, hormone-making glands, kidneys, or other organs. This can cause life-threatening conditions, so it's very important to report any new side effects to your health care team promptly. If serious side effects do occur, treatment may need to be stopped and you may get high doses of corticosteroids to suppress your immune system. It is important to tell your treatment team about the symptoms you have. They may be able to help.  If you have chest pain or trouble breathing, call 911.

Clinical trials are research studies that test new treatments and decide whether the new treatment is safe, how well it works, and whether it is better than the treatment that is currently considered the best treatment. Clinical studies may test a new drug, or how well more than one treatment works together or whether a higher or lower dose of a drug is more effective. All of the treatments that people get for cancer have been studied in clinical trials and any future advances in cancer care will be due to people joining clinical trials. There are risks, as there are for any cancer treatment, but clinical trials are often where patients have access to cutting edge treatment and very close monitoring.

<Content id="0">Many people taking cancer medications report a loss of appetite or no desire to eat. This can be caused by pain, depression, nausea and vomiting or advanced disease. It's important to eat healthy so that your body has the energy to fight the cancer. Some things that may help with your lack of appetite and nutrition are: &#8226; Eat small meals or snacks, every two to three hours, instead of three large meals a day &#8226; Eat foods that are rich in nutrients and high in protein or calories. &#8226; Avoid low-calorie foods &#8226; Drink nutrient-dense fluids such as milk, milk shakes, juice and punch-type drinks. &#8226; Avoid heavy meals, greasy or fried foods, and foods that cause gas. &#8226; Prepare food that is colorful and appealing to the eye. &#8226; Talk to your doctor about your appetite issues. There are medications that may be prescribed to combat lack of appetite. For more strategies to help with your appetite problems check out the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How does cancer treatment affect sexual function?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Cancer treatments can cause sexual changes for some patients. This is not unusual, and you are not alone. The most common issue is overall loss of desire. Just dealing with side effects from your cancer treatment may take so much energy that sex is not high on your priority list. For women, vaginal dryness and pain are often reported. For men, erectile problems are common. Most men and women are still able to have an orgasm, but it is common to need more time or stimulation to reach orgasm. If you are not receiving treatment for a hormone sensitive tumor, you may be a candidate for hormone replacement treatment. One of the most important things you can do is to share your concerns with your partner and talk to your health care team.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the symptoms of lung cancer?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Lung cancer may cause no symptoms at all until the tumor grows to a size that it affects other parts of the body near the lungs, or makes breathing difficult. When there are symptoms, they can include a cough that does not go away with treatment and becomes painful. If you have a cough that brings up blood or rust-colored mucus you should see your doctor. Shortness of breath, wheezing or noisy breathing and frequent lung infections such as bronchitis or pneumonia may also be signs of lung cancer. With many types of cancer you may experience a loss of appetite and unintended weight loss, and you may feel weak or unusually tired. At times, it is the metastases, or lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the body that cause the first symptoms. These symptoms depend on what part of the body the lung cancer has spread to. Symptoms from metastases can include bone pain, swelling or lumps in the face, arms or neck, headaches, dizziness, limbs that become weak or numb, or yellowing of the skin and eyes called jaundice. Most of these symptoms can be caused by other conditions as well, so it is important that you see a doctor to find out what is causing your symptoms. There are other symptoms that are caused by specific forms of lung cancer. For more information on these specific groups of symptoms, look in the related questions area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are lymph nodes</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Lymph nodes are small, bean shaped organs that help to filter fluids in the body and fight infection. They are part of the lymphatic system which is a network of vessels, like veins. These vessels carry lymph, which is filled with infection fighting white blood cells. Because lymph nodes filter damaged cells, viruses and germs from the body, they are usually the first place in the body that cancer spreads to. The lymph nodes closest to the original cancer growth are called sentinel nodes. These nodes are often examined to see if a cancer has begun to spread.</Content>

<Content id="0">Tumors in the upper part of the right lung can press on the large vein that carries blood from the head and arms back to the heart. This vein is called the superior vena cava or SVC. Pressing on the SVC can cause the blood to back up in the veins. This can lead to swelling in the face, neck, arms, and upper chest. Sometimes the skin in these areas looks a bluish-red color. SVC can also cause headaches, dizziness, and a loss of alertness. While these symptoms may come on slowly over time, in some cases they can become life-threatening, and need to be treated right away. If you have any of these symptoms, make sure to contact your doctor as soon as possible.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are paraneoplastic syndromes?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Hormones are chemicals that your body uses to get things done. They convert food into energy and break down the medicines that you take. They also help the immune system that fights disease in your body, and they carry messages from your brain to other parts of your body. Some cancers make hormone-like chemicals that cause problems in other areas of your body, even though the cancer has not spread to those areas. These problems are called paraneoplastic syndromes. The symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes can be the first signs of cancer that you notice. Depending on what part of the body is affected, you may have symptoms including tiredness, loss of appetite and weight loss, weakness or clumsiness, changes in taste, smell, or sight, and problems with memory or thinking skills, or even sleep. Because these symptoms affect many different organs and can be caused by conditions other than cancer, doctors may need to do several tests to find out whether it is cancer that is causing your symptoms. If you have any of these problems, it's important to see your doctor right away so the cause can be found and treated, if needed. For information on specific types of paraneoplastic syndromes, look in the related questions area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone)?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">When cancer cells make a hormone called anti-diuretic hormone, or ADH, it causes your kidneys to hold on to too much water, and lowers the amount of sodium in your blood. This is called syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone or SIADH. Although you may have heard that high sodium is bad for you, your body does need some sodium. Sodium helps carry messages from the brain to the rest of the body. So, if there is not enough sodium in your blood it can cause tiredness, loss of appetite, muscle weakness or cramps, feeling sick to your stomach and throwing up. You may also feel unable to stay still, and you may become confused. Without treatment, severe cases may lead to seizures and coma.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is Cushing syndrome?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Cancer cells may make Adrenocorticotropic hormone called ACTH. This hormone causes the adrenal glands to another hormone called cortisol. Cortisol affects blood sugar levels, helps change food into energy, reduces swelling, and helps with memory. It balances the amount of salt and water in the blood and helps control blood pressure. If too much cortisol is made, it is called Cushing syndrome. The symptoms of Cushing syndrome are weight gain, easy bruising, weakness, drowsiness, and the build-up of fluids called edema. Cushing syndrome can also cause high blood pressure and high blood sugar levels or even diabetes.</Content>

<Content id="0">Cancer can sometimes cause the body's immune system to attack parts of the nervous system and weaken some of the muscles in your hips, shoulders, arms and legs. One of the first signs may be trouble getting up from a sitting position. Later, muscles around the shoulder may become weak. If the immune system attacks a part of the brain called the cerebellum it can cause loss of balance and unsteadiness in arm and leg movement, as well as trouble speaking or swallowing. This is called paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. These symptoms can also be caused by some cancer treatments so it is important to tell your doctor about any of these symptoms.</Content>

<Content id="0">Thrombophlebitis happens when a blood clot forms in a vein. The clot might be in a vein might be near the surface of your skin, which is called superficial thrombophlebitis; or the clot may form deep within a muscle, called deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. When the clot is in a vein close to the surface of your skin, you might see a red, hard cord that feels mildly painful to the touch. This type of blood clot usually goes away on its own after a few days. However, when the clot is in a deep vein, your leg may become swollen, tender and painful. This is a serious situation because the blood clot can break loose and travel to your lungs, causing a life-threatening condition called pulmonary embolism. If you have leg swelling and pain and the develop shortness of breath or chest pain that worsens when you breathe, go to an emergency room. These might indicate that you have a blood clot traveling through your veins to your lungs.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are metastases?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">When cancer spreads from the part of the body where it starts to a different part of the body, it is called metastases. You may hear metastases called "mets". Even though the cancer is now in a different location, the cancer cells have the same structure as the cells in the original or primary tumor. So, even if lung cancer metastasizes to the brain, this "brain tumor" is actually made up of lung cancer cells. This is why cancer that has spread from its original location to another part of the body is described by the location of the original tumor. For instance, lung cancer that has spread to the brain is called a lung cancer metastases to the brain.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are monoclonal antibodies?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Monoclonal antibodies are drugs that use your body's own immune system to attack cancer cells. Antibodies are like markers that attach onto parts of cells called antigens. Monoclonal antibodies are made to attach themselves to the antigens on cancer cells. The monoclonal antibodies then attract other immune system cells and together they attack and kill the cancer cell. Monoclonal antibodies are injected into your vein. You may have a slight allergic like reaction to the injection, usually when you first start getting them. Compared to chemotherapy drugs side effects from most monoclonal antibodies are usually not as serious. They may include fever, chills, weakness, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, low blood pressure and skin rashes. Some monoclonal antibodies can have more serious side effects and you should talk to your doctor about the side effects of all medications you are taking.</Content>

<Content id="0">A bronchoscope is a very thin tube with a light on the end. Doctors do bronchoscopy to see inside the lungs. There may also be tiny tools inside the tube that take samples of the lung or fluid surrounding the lungs so that they can be examined under a microscope. Depending on what type of bronchoscope is used you may either have general anesthesia that makes you go to sleep, or you will be awake, but will get medicine to block the pain and discomfort. If you're awake for the bronchoscopy, the back of your throat will be sprayed with a medication to numb it and prevent gagging. The doctor will put the tube through your nose or mouth then into your wind pipe and through the breathing passages of your lungs. There are different types of bronchoscopy. During a navigational or "virtual" bronchoscopy, your doctor uses CT scans to see your airways in more detail. For an endobronchial ultrasound, also called Radial EBUS bronchoscopy, your doctor uses an ultrasound probe attached to a bronchoscope to see your airways.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Why is it so important to follow my medication schedule?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">You may be getting your cancer medications at your doctor's office or cancer center, or you may take oral chemotherapy drugs at home. Taking your medication how and when your doctor has told you to is very important. There are a number of reasons why someone might not want to take their medication -- side effects can be very difficult to deal with, and drugs that treat cancer can be very expensive. If you take oral cancer medications, you may be tempted to skip doses or cut them in half, but you should not do this. First of all, oral cancer drugs should not be crushed, split, broken or chewed. Also, your treatment will not be as effective and you may even make your cancer worse if you do not get the full dose that your doctor has prescribed. Your health care providers know that these medications cause side effects and they can often suggest ways to lessen the effects that these medications have on your health. They also know how expensive the medications can be and can point you towards a less expensive treatment or help you find resources to help you pay for your treatment. If, for any reason, you are thinking about skipping treatments or changing the dose of any of your medications, please talk to your doctor or nurse before you do.</Content>

Although your health care providers will have your medical records, you may need to go to the emergency room or see another doctor that does not have access to your records. For this reason, always keep a detailed list of your medications with you as well as information on how to reach your oncologist. Also, keep a journal or notebook of all your doctor visits and treatments that you've had. Make sure your family members or caregivers know your treatment wishes so that they can relay them to a health care provider if you are unable to. Another way to keep track of your treatment is using the MyChart app.  This free program enables users to check lab results, schedule or cancel appointments, review current medications, and message your doctor.

<Content id="0">Cancer medications may interact with other prescription or over-the-counter drugs as well as herbal medicines and even some foods. The chances of a drug interaction increase with the number of medications you take. You should keep a list of all the prescription and non-prescription medicines you are taking and share this with your health care team and any other health care provider you see. This is very important because some medicines can affect how well cancer drugs work and may also cause adverse side effects or dangerous drug interactions. Your list should include: &#8226; The name of the drug &#8226; The dose &#8226; How often you take it &#8226; Who prescribed it &#8226; And why you are taking it. Be sure you include any herbal and dietary supplements, vitamins and minerals and over the counter medications like aspirin. Also, eye drops, skin cream or patches.

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is esophagitis?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Esophagitis is when the throat becomes inflamed and swollen. In people being treated for lung cancer, this may be an unfortunate side effect from radiation to the chest. It is particularly common in people who receive chemotherapy and radiation at the same time but can also happen when just radiation is being used. To prevent and manage esophagitis, there are several things you can do: &#8226; Eat soft foods. Avoid foods that may be sharp, like chips &#8226; Avoid spicy, citrus, or acidic foods &#8226; Avoid drinking alcohol or using tobacco products &#8226; Eat small meals throughout the day instead of three big meals. &#8226; Ask your doctor about pain relievers such as anesthetic lozenges or mouthwash. Try using them before you eat to numb your throat and reduce discomfort.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I adjust to life after cancer treatment?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Life after cancer treatment is different for each person, depending on the type of cancer they have and the treatment they received. Some people finish their cancer treatment and then see their doctor for regular follow-up exams and tests to make sure their cancer has not come back. Other people, whose cancer may never go away completely, may continue to get treatment to manage their cancer for as long as possible. Lung cancer survivors tell us that although they are relieved to be done with their cancer treatment, the period after treatment can bring its own set of challenges. After the shock and fear of the cancer diagnosis, treatment often gives people a sense of purpose around completing treatment and beating cancer. But when treatment is over, or they are receiving maintenance treatment to keep their cancer in check, they need to adjust to a new normal. Along with fears about their cancer coming back or getting worse, making this adjustment can cause feelings of anxiety and depression. No matter what your experience, please know that all of these feelings are normal. You have been through a physical and mental battle with a tough opponent. There are things you can do to help during this time. Look in the Resource and Related questions area for information on life after cancer treatment.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How do I deal with feelings of fear?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">	No matter where you are in your cancer journey, it is common to feel fear. Initially you may fear the cancer treatments and side effects. After treatment, you may feel as though you're waiting for more bad news, and if your cancer returns or gets worse, you may fear of losing your independence and being a burden to your loved ones, and you may fear dying. Sometimes these fears hover in the background while you live your life, then suddenly surface again when you have a check-up or hear of someone else's diagnosis. Usually, these feelings come and go, and for most people they do not interfere with everyday life. But, if anxiety or fear keeps you from talking about your health, making doctor's appointments, or enjoying relationships with family and friends, it is time to talk to your doctor. There are things you can do to deal with your fears and your doctor may be able to help. For more information, look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Will my cancer come back?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">First and foremost in the minds of many cancer survivors and their caregivers is "will the cancer come back?" Your chances of recurrence depend on many things, such as your overall health and lifestyle, the type and stage of cancer, the type of treatments you received and your family history. No one can tell for certain whether your cancer will return or not -- even if tests show no sign of cancer after treatment. Certain cancers can recur many years after first being found and treated. For some cancers, if it has not recurred by five years after initial diagnosis, the chance of a later recurrence is very small. Your doctor should discuss your chances of recurrence with you as well as ways that you can minimize the risk of cancer returning. While you don't want to ever think about the chance of having a second cancer -- one that's not related to the first cancer -- this is also possible. Having one cancer doesn't make you immune to having a second or even a third different cancer. It is entirely normal to worry about recurrence, especially during the first few years after treatment. These worries may increase around holidays and other special occasions - such as the anniversary of the date you were diagnosed with cancer. Many survivors report that this worry fades over time. But, if you find that your fears keep you from enjoying life and effect your sleep or eating habits, or if you avoid following up with visits because you fear finding out that your cancer has returned, it is time to talk with your health care provider. Having a sense of control over your health is key to reducing anxiety about cancer's return, so learn about your cancer and ask your doctor what you can do to stay healthy. Make sure to talk about your feelings with others. Many people find that just sharing their concerns with loved ones, or in a support group, can help them to let go of their worries. There are other suggestions for managing the concern about recurring cancer in the Related Questions and Resource areas.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Can I work while getting cancer treatments?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Many cancer patients who work fulltime continue working throughout treatment. For many, working actually helps to keep their mind occupied and off their diagnosis. If your work is physically or mentally demanding, doing your job may become more challenging, and you may need to adjust your schedule or your workload or you may even need to take some time off during your treatment. You are not obligated to tell your boss or co-workers about your diagnosis, but being open sometimes helps set realistic expectations, especially when asking for flexibility in your schedule and planning for absence. Before you talk to anyone in your workplace about your diagnosis, find out if you have and are eligible for short-term or long-term disability insurance at your job. If you do decide to talk about your cancer, have a face-to-face meeting with your supervisor and express a strong desire to keep working. Let them know that while you currently plan to continue working, your situation might change. If you disclose your diagnosis to your employer you may also be able to benefit from the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act. Keep in mind that what you tell your boss is protected information and should be kept in confidence. You can find out more about the Americans with Disabilities and Family and medical leave act in the resource center.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What if I can't work during my treatment?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Sometimes, even with good planning and extra time off, it may be too much to keep working during cancer treatment. Talk with your health care team about how your treatment and symptoms are affecting your work. This may help you decide if or when you should to think about taking time off. Plan for possible disability early. Don't put off taking leave until your work performance suffers. If you are fired for doing a poor job, you can lose your health insurance as well as your income. And, if you're fired, you cannot collect disability benefits. If your treatment starts causing too many problems for you at work, talk to your supervisor. Explain that you want to keep working, but you need to take some time off. Talk to someone from your human resources department to find out if you have short-term or long-term disability insurance at your job. If you do, get applications for both -- just in case. In general, short-term disability pays you some portion of your income for the first few months you are unable to work. If you must be out longer, some employers also carry long-term disability insurance, which usually starts after 6 months of disability. You must meet the insurance company's definition of disability to get this income. Even if your company does not offer disability insurance you may still qualify for family medical leave under the FMLA program.

Also, keep in mind that our renowned doctors provide high quality, compassionate care for every type of cancer and follow universally accepted treatment standards set by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, an alliance of 27 leading cancer centers.  Our physicians participate in Allegheny Health Network tumor boards where doctors discuss cases, get input from other physicians and healthcare providers to ensure that your doctor prescribes the best possible cancer treatment and care plan for you. We also belong to a Cancer Collaborative with Highmark and Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center which among other benefits, gives our patients access to experts in rare cancers and priority participation in innovative clinical trials.  Another thing to keep in mind when considering a second opinion is that some insurance plans may not pay for consultations or tests that they feel are not warranted and you may need to pay for these services out-of-pocket.

It addresses the medical, emotional, spiritual and social needs of the person who is ill and their loved ones. Supportive care can begin anytime that a person is diagnosed with an illness that may be life-limiting. Medically, supportive care focuses on symptom care, such as pain management, managing shortness of breath, and treating any condition that reduces comfort or quality of life. It can be provided along with treatments to extend life or can be employed when life extending treatment has stopped. Supportive care can be provided in any setting -- hospital, skilled nursing facility, in hospice or at home.</Content>

<Content id="0">Staying as healthy as possible is more important than ever after lung cancer treatment. Follow your doctor's recommendations for follow up visits and tests so that if there are any signs of recurrence they can be caught early. And as far as making changes to your lifestyle, you should follow the same guidelines that doctors recommend for cancer prevention which includes: quitting smoking, eating a diet low in red meat and processed meat, and rich in vegetables, avoiding alcohol, lowering your weight if you are obese, avoiding saturated fats and, being physically active for at least 150 minutes a week, and including strength training at least twice a week. There is no certain way to make sure that your cancer doesn't return, but following these recommendations can improve your overall health and lower your risk of recurrence.

<Content id="0">There is no right or wrong approach to making decisions about your treatment options. Treatment can change based on changing circumstances; for example, you can opt for full medical treatment until you are certain it will not cure your cancer or halt the cancer's growth, or until quality of life has gotten worse and cannot be made better. At any time, you can transition to more comfort measures and less medical measures. Or, you may decide to use life extending treatments until a goal is reached, such as the birth or graduation of a grandchild, a family trip, or the arrangement of financial and other affairs that are important to you and your loved ones. Also, these are not either-or options -- you can choose to continue having some cancer treatments and not others.

Or, if someone has a personal goal that they want to reach such as getting their finances in order or seeing a loved one graduate or get married, they can receive life extending treatment along with supportive care until that goal is achieved, then stop that treatment in favor of palliative care alone when they feel ready.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Who can tell me what benefits I have / talk to me about financial concerns?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Paying for medical care is often of great concern for people with cancer and their family members. Everyone wants the best care possible, but there are often very real financial concerns. Depending on what kind of medical insurance is involved, some services may be covered, others covered only partly, and others not at all. We've provided links to information on Medicare and VA coverage in the Resources area. If you have private insurance, you should contact their member benefits area to find out what kind of coverage you have and what it will pay for. If you are uninsured or unable to pay for medical care, Allegheny Health Network has programs that can help meet your needs. Contact information is in the Resources area.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What if my family members don't agree with my treatment decisions?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">It can be difficult for family members to agree on care for their loved one who is dying. Everyone comes to acceptance of death in a different way and at a different pace. If one person has been closer to and providing more care for a loved one, they may more readily accept the doctor's prognosis, while others may still be in denial and see discontinuing medical care as giving up. Other family issues can complicate discussions and decisions around end-of-life as well. We hope that by sharing the link to this program with everyone involved in the decision process, you can resolve any differences among family members. Talking with social workers, clergy, the supportive care team or the ethics committee can also help families reach agreement.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What should I do about follow-up visits?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">It's important that you stick to your doctor's schedule for follow up. For some people, these follow-up visits cause anxiety and you may be tempted to put them off. Please do not delay or skip follow-up visits or tests. These visits are about more than just finding out if your cancer has returned --they are about understanding what to expect for the future and how you can regain control over your health. At your follow up visits, you can ask your doctor about any new symptoms you have, find out what long-term side effects to expect, and get support for life style changes such as quitting smoking or eating healthy. For information about getting the most out of your follow up visits, and for support to quit smoking, look in the Resource Area.</Content>

<Content id="0">Chemotherapy is usually given in cycles, which means you will have chemotherapy treatment followed by a period of rest from chemotherapy. A cycle can last one or more days, but is usually one, two, three, or four weeks long. A course of chemotherapy is a schedule of multiple cycles. For instance, your doctor may prescribe a 6-week course of chemotherapy that includes a cycle of two days of chemo and 5 rest days a week.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How do the lungs work?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">You probably know that your lungs take in oxygen when you breathe in, and that they get rid of carbon dioxide when you breathe out. But how does that happen? As you inhale air through your mouth and nose, the air heads down your trachea, or windpipe. The air flows through branching tubes in your lungs, called the bronchi and the bronchioles. These bronchioles end in the tiny air sacs called alveoli. Blood that is pumped from the heart to the lungs picks up oxygen from the alveoli and carries it to cells all over the body. As it travels around to your cells, it exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide which is made by your cells. After it makes its way around your body and is full of carbon dioxide, the blood comes back through heart and to the lungs where it drops off the carbon dioxide in the alveoli. The carbon dioxide is then pushed out of the lungs when you breathe out.</Content>

<Content id="0">These surgeries are done by a thoracic surgeon in an operating room and you will be given medication to make you go to sleep. You will also have a tube in your throat to help you breathe. The tube will not be removed until after you wake up from surgery and can breathe on your own. Recovery time from these surgeries depends on how much of your lung is removed and how healthy you were before surgery. You may experience shortness of breath for several months after these procedures while your lungs recover. This can be frustrating, especially if you were not having any trouble breathing before your surgery.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How do I know what treatment to get?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Your doctor will discuss your treatment options with you and talk about what the goals of each treatment option are. Depending on your prognosis, some treatments are done in hopes that they will cure your cancer. Others are done to slow the spread of the disease. These are called medical treatments. Other treatments are done only to lessen the symptoms of cancer and make you more comfortable. These are called supportive or palliative care services. Supportive care services can be used at any time during your illness, alongside medical care or alone. When discussing your prognosis and treatment options, make sure to tell your doctor what your goals for treatment are and to ask what outcomes are realistic to expect from each treatment option. This can help you decide what treatments are right for you. Treatment can change based on changing circumstances, for example you can opt for full medical treatment until you are certain it will not cure or halt the disease progression or until quality of life has gotten worse and cannot be made better. Then, when you are ready, you can transition to more comfort measures and less medical measures.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">How do I talk to my loved ones about my diagnosis</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Cancer is a frightening diagnosis and discussing cancer can be uncomfortable for the person with cancer as well as for family members, caregivers and other loved ones. The person with cancer may wish to spare their loved ones from the possibility that they may die, and caregivers may be uncomfortable thinking about the fact they too will die one day, or they may not want to break down or upset their loved one by showing too much emotion. Although it can be difficult, most people are relieved to talk openly about these issues. It's important to let the other person know how you are feeling about having this discussion, be open about your emotions, your needs and what you're able to handle. Some people need to talk about their feelings, beliefs and fears around dying, others may prefer only succinct, factual discussions. Open communication is the key to any discussion about cancer. Social workers, clergy, or members of your health care team can also be helpful with this.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Who is on my care team?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Your care team includes your medicaloncologist, who is the doctor who will coordinate your cancer treatment and prescribe cancer fighting medications; as well as other cancer specialists who may treat your cancer such as a surgical oncologist who removes tumors and does some types of biopsies, or a radio oncologist who treats cancer with radiation. You may also have a thoracic surgeon who specializes in operating on the chest. You will also be cared for by oncology nurses, and an oncology social worker or patient navigator who guides patients and their families through the health care system and helps them work with other team members to make sure they can complete treatment. Other professionals who are involved in your care include a pathologist who looks at the results of tests such as blood tests or biopsies to diagnose cancer, and a radiologist who diagnoses cancer by looking at the results of x-rays CT, PET, or MRI scans. Your oncologist may refer you to other specialists depending on your needs, including a supportive care or palliative care physician who focuses on meeting patients' physical, emotional, spiritual and social needs over the course of their illness, a dietician who can help with nutritional needs such as loss of appetite, and chewing and swallowing issues, and, also, a physical therapist who can help you improve your strength and activity level.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the risk factors for lung cancer?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Smoking is often thought of as the main risk factor for lung cancer, but having a risk factor, or even several, does not mean that you will get the disease. And some people who get lung cancer may have few or no known risk factors. Factors that increase your risk of having lung cancer include: Smoking tobacco of any kind, including low tar and menthol cigarettes, cigars, and pipes. Your risk of developing lung cancer increases the longer you smoke and the more packs a day you smoke. Smokers who take beta carotene supplements have an even higher rate of lung cancer than smokers who do not take the supplements. Secondhand smoke, breathing the tobacco smoke of others even though you do not smoke yourself, also increases your risk of developing lung cancer. Exposure to other things in the environment such as radon gas, asbestos, diesel exhaust, arsenic and other chemicals and higher levels of air pollution in cities and near roadways are also risk factors. Having a prior diagnosis of lung cancer puts you at a higher risk for developing another lung cancer. And, a close family member with a history of lung cancer, especially if they were diagnosed at a younger age, signals an increased risk as well.</Content>

<Content id="0">I know you've probably heard this already from your doctor or other health care provider, friends or family members, but I'm going to tell you once again, it's very important that you quit smoking. In fact, you should stop using any form of tobacco as soon as you can. Any form of tobacco use can affect how you respond to treatment, can cause complications during surgery, and can increase the damage that cancer does to your organs. You probably know that quitting tobacco use is not easy. It's probably not news to you that nicotine is one of the most powerfully addictive substances. When you stop using nicotine, as with any addictive substance, you go through withdrawal. Withdrawal from nicotine can cause you to; Feel irritable, angry, or anxious Have trouble thinking Crave tobacco products Feel hungrier than usual You may have tried to quit many times before and you're not alone in this. More than 85% of people who try to quit on their own fail within the first week. But you don't have to try to quit on your own. There are many resources available for people looking to quit. Your doctor can help by prescribing medications to reduce your cravings and counseling can help as well. Please, talk to your healthcare team about quitting smoking and other tobacco use today. It's never too late to benefit from quitting.  Look in the Resources area for support for quitting smoking.</Content>

Even if you formerly used tobacco and have quit, your body will benefit. If you are a former tobacco user, you know that quitting tobacco use is not easy. It's probably not news to you that nicotine is one of the most powerfully addictive substances. So, I want you to keep in mind how important it is that you remain tobacco free. Please, if you are at all tempted to start using tobacco again, talk to your doctor or other member of your health care team.

These include imaging tests such as CT or PET scans, and possibly an MRI scan. A pulmonary function test is important to show the surgeon how well you're able to breath and how much lung tissue can be removed.

<Content id="0">The number one thing you can do to prepare yourself for lung cancer surgery is to stop using any tobacco products as soon as possible. Not only does smoking affect the health of your lungs and other organs, but any form of tobacco use slows down the healing process. Your doctor may ask you to use a spirometer before surgery to strengthen your lungs and the muscles in your chest that help you to breath. Using a spirometer regularly before surgery can have a big impact on your recovery after surgery. There is information on spirometer use in the Resources area. Also, stay as active as possible leading up to your surgery, eat a good diet, and follow the pre-surgery instructions that your health care team gives you.

<BaseQuestion id="0">How can I keep my loved-ones safe while I'm taking cancer medications?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Cancer medications are powerful drugs whether they are given in a doctor's office or taken at home. These drugs don't just affect cancer cells -- they can be harmful to healthy cells as well. For this reason, people who are not being treated for cancer should not have contact with any cancer drugs, including chemotherapy, hormones, and targeted therapies. These should all be regarded as hazardous drugs. If you take oral chemotherapy drugs at home, you should keep your medications away from other family members and pets. Your family members should wear disposable gloves if they must help you with your medications because even small amounts can be dangerous to them. If you touch your medications, you should wash your hands before touching anything else. The outsides of bottles or blister packs may also contain traces of the drugs. Even though it may only be a trace amount, it can be absorbed through skin, inhaled, or ingested or can transfer to surfaces if not handled properly. Pregnant caregivers should never handle oral cancer medications. Look in the related questions for other information on safe handling. It takes about 72 hours for the body to break down or get rid of most cancer drugs. During that time, a small amount of the drug comes out in urine, stool, vomit and blood. Items soiled with body fluids should be kept in plastic bags until washed, and should be washed separately from other laundry. Pregnant caregivers should be very careful to not come in contact with oral cancer medications or your body fluids. Low-pressure toilets should be double-flushed after use by people taking oral cancer drugs. And, always close the toilet lid before flushing. For more information on medication safety, look at the related questions area of this page.</Content>

<Content id="0">Side effects from cancer treatments can make working through treatment a challenge. Cancer treatments can affect your memory and your ability to think clearly. Some people find that using additional reminders can help them. You can use sticky notes; keep a calendar, record messages on your smart phone--whatever it takes to help you keep track of appointments, meetings and deadlines. There are other things that may help you keep working through treatment, for instance: &#8226; If possible, work from home some days. This might help you save energy and allow you to take care of yourself more easily if you have problems. &#8226; If possible, get help at home with daily chores like housekeeping and cooking. This will help you conserve energy. &#8226; If your co-workers know about your situation they may be able to help you come up with ways to better manage your work. &#8226; Keep your supervisor up to date on how your schedule or other changes are working for you. &#8226; Make a detailed list of job duties, so you can direct others in handling things when you're out of the office &#8226; Set limits.

<BaseQuestion id="0">When will I start treatment</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Once you are diagnosed, you may want to start treatment as soon as possible.  However, there may be some additional procedures that you need to go through before your treatment actually beings.  Depending on your type of cancer and what tests you've already had, your doctor may need for you to have tests or scans done to accurately stage your cancer. If you will be having chemotherapy or other treatment delivered by an IV, you may have to have a port or catheter inserted under your skin to make treatments easier to administer.  There may also be insurance authorizations and other paperwork that you need to complete before treatment starts.  Talk to your cancer care team to see what steps need to be taken so that you can start your treatment.</Content>

<Content id="0">As a cancer survivor, it is important to follow your doctor's recommendations for healthy living and to continue to receive screenings for the usual health problems.  But, you should pay particular attention to annual vaccinations for the flu and pneumonia as well as getting a shingles vaccine.  Monitoring your blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose levels is especially important as well.  Bone density can be affected by some cancer treatments, so bone density scans are recommended, and you should continue to get regular dental checkups.  Be sure to wear sun screen whenever you are outdoors.  It is important to eat a healthy diet, get at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week, and limit the amount of alcohol you drink.   Talk to you doctor to see if there are any additional recommendations that you should follow to reduce your risk of recurrence or developing other cancers.

 talking to your oncologist or cancer navigator regarding your prognosis information.</Content>

<Content id="0">394  Okay, I'll listen to the prognosis information

I'm glad you've decided to find out more about your prognosis.  Here are some things to remember when learning about your prognosis. Doctors often use the 5-year survival rate when talking about prognosis. This is the percentage of people at least 5 years after their cancer diagnosis. But many people live longer -- often much longer -- than 5 years. For example, a 5-year survival rate of 50% means that an estimated 50 out of 100 people who have that cancer are still alive 5 years after being diagnosed. And many of those people have many years yet to go. These numbers can't tell you how long you will live, but they may help give you a better understanding about how likely it is that your treatment will be useful. Keep in mind as you hear this information that statistics are estimates, educated guesses that describe trends in large numbers of people. These statistics do not necessarily predict what will actually happen to you.</Content>
