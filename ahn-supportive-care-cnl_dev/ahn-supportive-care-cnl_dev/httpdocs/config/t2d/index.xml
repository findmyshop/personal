<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a clinical trial?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A clinical trial is a study performed to test investigational medications, vaccines, or devices for various diseases and conditions. These studies determine if the investigational medication works and is safe to use. Before an investigational medication, or medical device can be made available to the general public, it has to go through several phases of clinical research. </Content>

<Content id="0">Clinical trials are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, known as the FDA in the United States. The role of the FDA is to ensure the study team follows a set of principles known as good clinical practices, or GCPs. These principles are designed to make sure the study participants are protected and the study team gets information from the clinical trial that they can potentially use to develop future treatment options. </Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the phases of a clinical trial?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical trials are typically performed in “phases.” Before an investigational medication can be tested in human subjects, testing occurs in a lab to gather data on whether the investigational medication may work for the disease. Next, the investigational medication transitions to something called a Phase I clinical trial, which typically involves a small number of healthy subjects and is designed to test whether the investigational treatment is safe and to determine what dose should be given. If the results show that the investigational medication is safe, it will move into Phase II clinical trials, where it will be tested in patients with the disease or condition to see whether the investigational medication has any effect on the disease. If the investigational medication works to treat a disease, it will enter Phase III trials, which involve a large number of patients to see if it is safe and effective. </Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the types of clinical trials?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are two main types of clinical trials: Placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials. A placebo-controlled trial means that one group of patients will receive the investigational medication, while a second group, often known as the control group, will receive something called a placebo. Placebo often looks just like the investigational medication but is designed to have no real effect on patients. Placebos are often used in blinded trials, which are trials where the patients do not know whether they are receiving the real investigational medication or placebo. This is done to account for the “placebo effect,” which is bias introduced into the study. Bias may result from a patient’s belief that he or she is receiving a certain investigational medication or the researcher’s belief that a certain result will occur.  In a head-to-head trial, one group of patients receives the investigational medication to be evaluated, while a second group of patients receives a different study medication. In most cases, the other study medication is a treatment that is already commonly used by patients. This is often referred to as the “standard of care.” These types of trials allow researchers to see how the investigational medication performs compared to approved treatments. When discussing clinical trials, you might notice that they can also be referred to as “single-blind” or “double-blind.” A single-blind study means that the investigators involved in the study know whether the study participant is getting the investigational medication, but the study participant does not know what they are receiving.In a double-blind trial, neither the investigator nor the study participant knows if the participant is receiving the investigational medication. By “blinding” the trials, no biases—whether real or unintentional—are introduced into the study. </Content>

<Content id="0">A Data Safety and Monitoring Committee, sometimes known as a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, is a group of experts who monitor patient safety and study medication effectiveness data during the course of a clinical trial. The group, which typically includes 3 to 10 members, can recommend that a trial be stopped because of safety concerns or because the study medication is not effective. Members of the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee are usually made up of doctors with knowledge of the disease or condition being treated, statisticians, and sometimes a patient advocacy representative. </Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">Are placebos ethical?</BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Patients participating in a placebo-controlled clinical trial are told during the informed consent process that there is a chance that they could receive the investigational medication or a placebo while participating in the study. A placebo often looks like the investigational medication, but it has no active ingredient. Placebos are used in clinical research to help evaluate the effectiveness of an investigational medication. Because some participants receive the placebo, the researchers can see the effects the investigational medication has on those who take it. Using a placebo during a study is ethical because the participant has been informed that there is a possibility that he or she will be receiving no treatment. In addition, there are usually protections built into the design of the study to ensure that a patient can be “rescued.” This may include initiating therapy with a medication that is known to be effective in treating the disease that is being studied. Rescue therapy is provided when the patient meets certain criteria that suggest that additional therapy is needed.</Content>

<Content id="0">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that potential study participants be given complete information about the planned trial under a process known as "informed consent." This process is designed to clearly inform individuals of the purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to the clinical trial. The informed consent process ensures that participants understand information about the study and how it relates to their own health. It also provides an opportunity for an individual to make a voluntary decision about whether to participate in the study. Following this discussion, you can choose to allow your child to participate in the trial by signing an informed consent form. Even if you sign the form, your child can still withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason. Your child may be asked to sign an assent form that covers the same information as the informed consent form</Content>

<Content id="0">All clinical trial participants are granted certain rights. For example, the Clinical Trial Volunteer’s Bill of Rights states that you and your child be given enough time to decide whether to participate and to make that decision without any pressure from the people who are doing the research. It also states that you can refuse to participate in the study and stop participating at any time. If you decide not to allow your child to participate, this will not affect the right your child has to receive medical care not related to the research. In addition, this bill of rights states that you have the right to be told why the clinical trial is being done, what will happen, and what you will be asked to do if you are in the trial. You’ll also be informed of any reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, or side effects that may occur during the trial and who will pay for any study-related treatment. This bill of rights also gives you the right to have your questions answered by the study team at any time, gives you access to information collected about you or your child, and requires that you receive a copy of the signed informed consent form. </Content>

<Content id="0">Over the course of the clinical trial, your child will continue to be treated by his or her regular doctor. This doctor will be in charge of providing all non-study related care, including care for any existing or new medical problems. It is important that you discuss with the study team any existing medical conditions your child has, as well as any other medications or treatments that your child may use, so that they have a complete picture of your child’s health before the study starts. The use of some medications is restricted during the study. The study doctor will ask you about the medications your child is currently taking and will tell you if any of them cannot be taken during the study. Otherwise, your child will continue taking his or her usual medication as prescribed by his or her doctor. If your child’s personal physician prescribes any other medication while your child is in this study, you must first consult your study doctor before your child takes these medications. Tell your doctor about any other medications your child is taking, as the investigational medication may alter how well other medications work.  In some cases, your child’s doctor may need to adjust your child’s medication to ensure that the medication is working properly. In the event that a new medical problem arises over the course of the study period, please inform both your child’s existing physician and study doctor so that they can best coordinate your child’s care. </Content>

<Content id="0">If you choose to allow your child to participate in the study, he or she will be required to go to designated facilities for all study-related procedures and testing. The reason this is required is because the health care workers at these sites have been trained on how to perform the tests in accordance with the study protocol. In addition, samples from all the participants are tested in the same lab, which makes interpreting the results easier. However, it should be noted that your child will continue to see his or her regular physician for any non-study related testing and care throughout the trial period; tests that can reveal the effectiveness of the investigational medication should be done only by the study doctor.  </Content>

This is done to ensure that the trial results are not influenced by what is known as the placebo effect. Placebo effect is caused by the patient’s belief that they are receiving a certain treatment, or through researcher bias.

Your child’s participation may help us better understand the effectiveness and safety of the investigational medication. There is a possibility that your child’s condition could worsen while he or she participates in the clinical trial. However, due to the close medical monitoring that is part of clinical trial protocols, any worsening of your child’s condition is likely to be detected early and appropriate treatment can be initiated in a timely manner.</Content>

<Content id="0">In the SITup 083 study, some participants will take the investigational medication, sitagliptin, and others will take placebo. Placebo looks like the investigational medication but has no active ingredients. Later in the study, your child may also begin taking a medication called metformin. Metformin is approved by regulatory agencies around the world to treat type 2 diabetes in adults and children. Sitagliptin, as well as placebo and metformin, are pills that will be provided in a blister pack. Pills will be taken twice per day—before breakfast and before dinner as directed by the study team.</Content>
