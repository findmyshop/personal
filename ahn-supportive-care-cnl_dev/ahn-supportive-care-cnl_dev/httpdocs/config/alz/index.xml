<BaseQuestion id="0">What is a clinical trial? </BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">A clinical trial is a study performed to test investigational medications, vaccines, or devices for various diseases and conditions. These studies determine if the investigational medication works and is safe to use. Before an investigational medication or medical device can be made available to the general public, it has to go through several phases of clinical research. </Content>

<Content id="0">Clinical trials are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, known as the FDA in the United States. The role of the FDA is to ensure the study team follows a set of principles known as good clinical practices, or GCPs. These principles are designed to make sure the study participants are protected and the study team gets information from the clinical trial that they can potentially use to develop future treatment options. </Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the phases of a clinical trial? </BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Clinical trials are typically performed in "phases." Before an investigational medication can be tested in humans, testing occurs in a lab to gather data on whether the investigational medication may work for the disease. Next, the investigational medication transitions to something called a Phase I clinical trial, which typically involves a small number of healthy subjects and is designed to test whether the investigational medication is safe and to determine what dose should be given. If the results show that the investigational medication is safe, it will move into Phase II clinical trials, where it will be tested in patients with the disease or condition to see whether the investigational medication has any effect on the disease. If the investigational medication works to treat a disease, it will enter Phase III trials, which involves a large number of patients to see if it is safe and effective.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What are the types of clinical trials? </BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">There are two main types of clinical trials: Placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials. A placebo-controlled trial means that one group of patients will receive the investigational medication, while a second group, often known as the control group, will receive something called a placebo. Placebo often looks just like the investigational medication but is designed to have no real effect on patients. Placebos are often used in blinded trials, which are trials where the patients do not know whether they are receiving the real investigational medication or placebo. This is done to account for the "placebo effect," which is bias introduced into the study. Bias may result from a patient's belief that he or she is receiving a certain investigational medication or the researcher's belief that a certain result will occur. In a head-to-head trial, one group of patients receives the investigational medication to be evaluated, while a second group of patients receives a different study medication. In most cases, the other study medication is a treatment that is already commonly used by patients. This is often referred to as the "standard of care." These types of trials allow researchers to see how the investigational medication performs compared to approved treatments. </Content>

<Content id="0">Clinical trials are monitored by a group called a Data Safety and Monitoring Committee, sometimes known as a Data and Safety Monitoring Board. This group of experts monitor patient safety and study medication effectiveness data during the course of a clinical trial. The group, which typically includes 3 to 10 members, can recommend that a trial be stopped because of safety concerns or because the study medication is not effective. Members of the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee are usually made up of doctors, statisticians, and sometimes a patient advocacy representative.</Content>

<Content id="0">There is no way to make sure you get a certain medication.If a trial is randomized, it means that study participants are assigned to a particular treatment group through a process called "randomization." This process, which is similar to a coin toss, ensures that patients are assigned to a study treatment group without any input from the study team.  </Content>

<Content id="0">Over the course of the clinical trial, you will be seen by a team that includes doctors and other health care professionals. However, this team will only provide care as part of the clinical trial, so it's important that you keep seeing your current doctor for regular checkups and other care while you participate in the trial. It is possible that your doctor is the doctor conducting the study. If that is not the case, you should tell your regular doctor that you are participating in a clinical trial. You should also tell the study doctor if you start taking any new medications not associated with the clinical trial or if there are any changes in your health.</Content>

<Content id="0">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that potential study participants be given complete information about the planned trial under a process known as "informed consent." This process is designed to clearly inform individuals of the purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to the clinical trial.The informed consent process ensures that participants understand information about the study and how it relates to their own health. It also provides an opportunity for an individual to make a voluntary decision about whether to participate in the study. Following this discussion, you can choose to participate in the trial by signing an informed consent form. Even if you sign the form, you can still withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason. </Content>

It is important that you discuss with the study team any existing medical conditions you have, as well as any other medications or treatments that you may use, so that they have a complete picture of your health before the study starts. The use of some medications is restricted during the study. The study doctor will ask you about the medications you are currently taking and will tell you if any of them cannot be taken during the study. Otherwise, you will continue taking your usual medications as prescribed by your doctor. If your regular doctor prescribes any medication while you are in this study, you must first consult your study doctor before taking it, as the investigational medication may alter how well other medications work.  In some cases, your regular doctor may need to adjust your medication to ensure that it is working properly. In the event that a new medical problem arises over the course of the study, please inform both your regular doctor and the study doctor so that they can best coordinate your care. </Content>

<Content id="0">This study is designed to be double-blind, which means you, your study partner, and the study doctor will not know whether you are taking the placebo or the investigational medication, which is called MK-8931.  This is done to ensure that the trial results are not influenced by what is known as the placebo effect. Placebo effect is caused by the patient's belief that they are receiving a certain treatment or through researcher bias. If you have concerns about receiving either of the study medications, please speak with the study team.</Content>

<BaseQuestion id="0">What is prodromal Alzheimer's disease? </BaseQuestion>
<Content id="0">Prodromal Alzheimer's disease is a very early stage of Alzheimer's disease when mild memory loss first begins to appear. People with prodromal Alzheimer's disease have more memory problems than what is considered normal for their age, but they remain able to carry out most daily activities. Early symptoms of prodromal Alzheimer's disease include having a hard time recalling conversations, stories you've read, important dates, or phone numbers, as well as trouble remembering where you put important items, such as your keys or wallet. Although minor forgetfulness is a common problem that comes with getting older, when it is happening more than normal, it may be time to talk to your doctor. To be diagnosed with prodromal Alzheimer's disease, a person must have memory loss in addition to a test showing that beta-amyloid is present in his or her brain. Beta-amyloid is a protein that interferes with normal brain cell function, causing memory loss.</Content>

<Content id="0">There is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease. Although there are treatments that help with the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, there are no treatments available that slow or stop its progression. Often, the disease develops slowly before memory loss is noticeable. Researchers in this clinical study are trying to find out if an investigational medication may be able to slow disease progression in people with prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Results of clinical research studies may lead to new prevention and treatment options that could help improve the lives of people with Alzheimer's disease, their families, and future generations.</Content>
