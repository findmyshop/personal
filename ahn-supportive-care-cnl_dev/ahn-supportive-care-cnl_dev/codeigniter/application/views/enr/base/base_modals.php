<p>An international team of management professionals and scientists, Decision Partners is the world leader in advanced behavioural decision research, strategy and communications services for focusing human decision making and behaviour. Our methods draw from current understanding in the relevant disciplines, including decision science, risk perception, risk communication and innovation. We are the leading commercial provider, worldwide, of Mental Modeling Technology™, a unique, evidence-based, science-informed management process for developing programs – policies, strategies and communications – for belief and behaviour change. The technology comprises integrated methods and tools on a software platform. Our applied cognitive behavioural approach enables systematic formulation of strategies and communications for shaping judgment, decision making and behaviour.</p>
<p>Our primary research method is mental models research, which is among the most robust of qualitative perception research methods. It yields rich and high quality data on the complex thinking of a small sample of individuals. The method relies primarily on qualitative data collected through expert elicitation techniques and/or focused, open-ended in-depth interviews conducted primarily by telephone, with experts or non-experts. Decision Partners also conducts mental models-based quantitative research, typically conducted through Internet-based surveys.</p>
<p>The Decision Partners’ Human Research Protections Program and Privacy Policy incorporates procedures to meet the highest level of compliance with ethical principles and guidelines for the protection of human research participants found in both the United States and Canada, including: </p>
<ul><li>The Report of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research entitled: “Ethical Principals and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research” (the “Belmont Report”) in the United States; and </li>
<li>The Interagency Advisory Panel on Research Ethics’ Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans 2nd Edition (TCPS 2) in Canada.
Decision Partners’ Human Research Protections Program and Privacy Policy also complies with the secure personal information management practices consistent with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) from the United States and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) in Canada.</li></ul>

				<div class="well">
<h5>HOW TO ENTER:</h5>
<p>During the Contest Period, visit the <a href="http://www.enersource.com/survey/" target="_blank">www.enersource.com/survey</a> (or www.electricitydialogue.ca) website to register and participate in the online Enersource Customer Survey Contest (the “Contest”). Depending on the individual, it will take about twenty (20) minutes to watch the videos on the components of our Long Term Plan and answer the eleven (11) mandatory questions in order to be eligible for the contest. Once the questions have been answered, participants will complete a Contest entry form to receive one (1) entry into the Contest.  In order to enter the Contest, participants will be required to provide an account number, first and last name and phone number. Limit: Only one (1) Contest entry will be permitted per Enersource account, regardless of the number of primary contacts on the account.</p>
<p>Enersource customers who wish to enter the Contest but do not have access to a computer may contact Enersource Hydro Mississauga by phone <strong>(905-283-4261)</strong> to request a paper copy of the Enersource Customer Survey to complete and mail in.  Mail-in entries must be received by the end of the Contest Period to be eligible for the Contest draw.</p>
<h5>WHO CAN ENTER<br/>
NO PURCHASE REQUIRED</h5>
<p>To enter the Contest you must be an Enersource customer who is the age of majority and resides in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, throughout the entire Contest Period (defined below), and have the ability to travel to Enersource Hydro Mississauga to claim your prize. Enersource Hydro Mississauga will not pay for or reimburse any expenses for travel to claim prize.</p>
<p>Employees of the Sponsor, the Agency, their affiliated companies and subsidiaries and their immediate family, as well as persons residing in their respective households, are not eligible to participate in the Contest. The Sponsor reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to eliminate any person from eligibility if he/she violates any term or condition of the Official Contest Rules. By entering the Contest, entrants agree to abide by the Official Contest Rules and the decisions of the Sponsor with respect to all aspects of the Contest, which are final.</p>

<h5>CONTEST PERIOD - November 23 to December 23, 2015</h5>
<p>The Contest runs from 12:01 a.m. Eastern Standard Time ("EST") November 23, 2015 to 11:59 p.m. EST on December 23, 2015 (the "Contest Period"). All entries must be received during the Contest Period.</p>

<h5>DRAW DATES</h5>

<p>All eligible entries received during the Contest will be entered into one random draw, which will occur within ten (10) business days after the Contest Period closes. To be eligible to participate in the draw, the eligible Contest entry must be received by the last day of the Contest Period.</p>

<h5>PRIZES</h5>

<p>There are eight (8) prize offerings consisting of a Samsung Galaxy Tablet.</p>

<h5>WINNER NOTIFICATION AND PRIZE DELIVERY</h5>

<p>The selected winners (the “Winner” or the “Winners”) will be notified by phone and/or email (based on Enersource account contact information) by the Sponsor or the Agency within ten (10) business days of the draw occurring.  In order to claim the prize, the selected Winners must correctly answer an unaided, time-limited, mathematical skill-testing question (the "Question").  Following which and within a further ten (10) business days, the selected Winners will be required to submit to the Sponsor a declaration and release form confirming compliance with the Official Contest Rules, acceptance of the prizes as awarded and releasing the Sponsor, the Agency and their respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees and representatives from any and all liability in connection with the prizes, use of the prizes or the Contest. The prize will be awarded to the primary contact on the Enersource account who entered the Contest, and the Winner must be able to pick-up the prize from the Sponsor’s Head Office. There are no substitutions for prizes, and prizes are non-refundable and non-transferable except at the sole discretion of the Sponsor.</p>
<p>Inability of the Sponsor to reach a selected Winner within the above time frame, failure by a selected Winner to answer the Question correctly, failure by a selected Winner to return a signed declaration and release form within the above time frame or refusal to accept delivery of a prize, results in a forfeit of the prize and the right for the Sponsor to re-draw the prize.</p>

<h5>ODDS OF WINNING </h5>

<p>Odds of winning depend upon the number of eligible entries received.</p>
