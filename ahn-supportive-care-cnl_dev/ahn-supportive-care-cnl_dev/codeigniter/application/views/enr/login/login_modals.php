<p>An international team of management professionals and scientists, Decision Partners is the world leader in advanced behavioural decision research, strategy and communications services for focusing human decision making and behaviour. Our methods draw from current understanding in the relevant disciplines, including decision science, risk perception, risk communication and innovation. We are the leading commercial provider, worldwide, of Mental Modeling Technology™, a unique, evidence-based, science-informed management process for developing programs – policies, strategies and communications – for belief and behaviour change. The technology comprises integrated methods and tools on a software platform. Our applied cognitive behavioural approach enables systematic formulation of strategies and communications for shaping judgment, decision making and behaviour.</p>
<p>Our primary research method is mental models research, which is among the most robust of qualitative perception research methods. It yields rich and high quality data on the complex thinking of a small sample of individuals. The method relies primarily on qualitative data collected through expert elicitation techniques and/or focused, open-ended in-depth interviews conducted primarily by telephone, with experts or non-experts. Decision Partners also conducts mental models-based quantitative research, typically conducted through Internet-based surveys.</p>
